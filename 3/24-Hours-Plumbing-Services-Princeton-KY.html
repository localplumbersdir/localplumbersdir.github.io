How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we recommend having them changed immediately. Before you can ask for an inspection, you need to first get the needed permit( s) for the work you intend to do. You can have a look at our License page to find out more on obtaining a permit.

Tough water leaves water areas on dishes, glasses, and utensils whether you are washing them by hand or in a dishwasher. Soft water takes care of this by lessening the minerals in the water. A license, in addition to the required health and safety inspections, are required for all brand-new and replacement plumbing setups. The replacement of existing plumbing components also needs an authorization and subsequent inspections.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not uncommon, but if your toilet is obstructing more than three times a month, there's a larger problem to examine. You might need to change toilet paper or work with a plumber to clear an obstruction from the drain if your toilet is reasonably new. The National Contractor License Service maintains a list of each state's professional licensing company where you can search for your state's licensing info. Examine the list of state licensing agencies to learn whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List likewise keeps a licensing tool to check state licensing requirements.</p>
