<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Stilwell OK</h3>
<p>When water is hard, it can clog pipes and soap will dissolve in it less quickly. Water softening can prevent these negative effects. Natural gas is a colorless, odor free fuel. As a safety preventative measure, we add a chemical odorant called mercaptan that gives natural gas an odor typically associated with rotten eggs. If it happens, this distinctive scent permits you to smell a possible leak. Constantly leave if you suspect a leak.</p>
<p>Because of the intrinsic design of a lowered pressure backflow assembly, changing supply pressure on an extremely low circulation or fixed flow condition might cause problem dripping and possible fouling of the assembly. While not effective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve immediately ahead of the RPZ will typically hold the pressure constant to the assembly in times of varying supply pressure.</p>
