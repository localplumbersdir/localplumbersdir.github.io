<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Happy Valley OR</h3>
<p>Likewise called a garbage disposer, a garbage disposal is available in two standard types - constant feed, which typically has a wall-mounted switch so the system keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which requires a food cover remain in place to operate the system. Constant feed prevails and the simplest to utilize; a batch feed design is safer but can be slower to utilize on big quantities of food waste because you need to process it in batches.
