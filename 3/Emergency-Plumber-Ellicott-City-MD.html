<p>Downsides to be familiar with is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that stays in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need up to 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater. Also, hybrids require approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to catch sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>
