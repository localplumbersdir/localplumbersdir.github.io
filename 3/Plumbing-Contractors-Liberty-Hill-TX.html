<p>The purpose of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to ensure that all plumbing installed throughout building of a brand-new or remodelled building is set up by knowledgeable craftsmen in accordance with suitable codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the dishes, or put flat soda in your sink, you usually understand your drain is clogged and needs cleaning. However, when a clogged drain materializes through flooding, the clog is more than likely in the draining fixture itself. Clogs in a component can cause destructive damage to your draining pipes system the longer they continue.</p>
<p>A waste disposal unit should not leak. It typically suggests wear and tear which is a fair sign that its time is up when this takes place. If you think of what you put down the disposal, leaks can be unhygienic and will also eventually cause strain on other parts of your garbage disposal. The kitchen sink drain may need a simple tightening or a replacement. You will see the obvious spray if the leak is in the pressurized hose spray. For a leak in the drain pipe, you might need to fill the sink with water prior to taking a look at the pipe beneath.</p>

That said, there are some instances when the cost of repair would measure up to that of a new piece of equipment. Therefore, if your garbage disposal system needs frequent repairs, or it's old and does not work all that well, give us a call. It may be time for garbage disposal replacement.</p>
