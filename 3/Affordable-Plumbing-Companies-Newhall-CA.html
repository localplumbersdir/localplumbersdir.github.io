<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit includes two fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and debris to grind versus a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without obstructing.</p>
