<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, that makes its plumbing's effective operating a requirement more than a need. Once the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair procedure. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be checked to make sure no valves were inadvertently exposed or did not close properly when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
