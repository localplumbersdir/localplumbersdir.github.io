<p>These guys were remarkable! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for many years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company since they had terrific reviews and a reasonable cost, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent task cleaning up after it too.</p>
