<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts might have really tight tolerances that need to be maintained. A crucial thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the part. The guide is a really crucial part of the style of each part. If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide could restrict the motion (instead of constant or direct) of the element, which could trigger the component to not work to its capabilities.

For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
