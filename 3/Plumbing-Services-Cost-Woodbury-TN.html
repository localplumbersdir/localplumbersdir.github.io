Difficult water hinders the lathering of soaps and hair shampoos, causing you to use more. Difficult water also makes it harder to wash soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and irritation of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that difficult water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and redden often.</p>
