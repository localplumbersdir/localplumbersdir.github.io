<p>While fighting a fire, firemens are not surprisingly more worried about drawing adequate water to splash the blaze than backflow prevention. Not just will they utilize water from any offered source to accomplish their goal, but fire department vehicles typically carry non-potable water treated with antifreeze, deterioration inhibitors, or extinguishing representatives.</p>
<p>The Delaware Division of Public Health Plumbing Authorization and Inspection Program has offices in Kent and Sussex Counties. For instance, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can cause water pipes to lose pressure. When that happens, water is no longer pushed forward into the residential or commercial property, enabling it to flow backwards into city water materials.</p>
<p>A variety of companies, such as the American Water Functions Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) use accreditation courses designed to train specialists to check backflow preventers. Requirements for training vary by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers requires knowledge of installation requirements, although inspectors are not needed to become certified.</p>
