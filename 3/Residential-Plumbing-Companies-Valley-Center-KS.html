<p>Backpressure may happen when the safe and clean supply piping is linked to a system or component which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping. Greater pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not effectively protected, drinkable and non-potable water or liquids can be pushed into the drinkable supply system.</p>
<p>However, most of the time, it's safe to say that any repairs that need to be finished will come out of the pocketbook of a property owner.
