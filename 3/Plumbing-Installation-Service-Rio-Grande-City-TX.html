<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when searching for a viable option, specifically when easy plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are many downsides to using these dangerous products - not least of which is that they generally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your home and family.</p>
