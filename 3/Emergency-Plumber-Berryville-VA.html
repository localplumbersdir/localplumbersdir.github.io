<p>The most effective way to address hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>3. Think about a hair-stopper: The number 1 factor our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning experts are called into a house is due to the fact that there is excessive hair in the shower drain. Hair-stoppers are simple and quite low-cost to install, so there's no reason not to. Eventually triggering a backup when grease solidifies it sticks to the pipe and prevents water flow. This included with other particles in your drain can trigger a significant backup.</p>
