<p>If the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span, a rule of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair. If, say, you need a new burner kit and the hot water heater is five years of ages, then it makes good sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more uncertain the economics of a repair ends up being. The factor is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>
