<p>All piping under faucets and sinks are checked for leaks or damage. How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them changed right away. Before you can ask for an inspection, you should first acquire the needed license( s) for the work you mean to do. You can check out our Permit page to learn more on obtaining a license. When you acquire a permit you can commence with the work. However, you should call for inspection prior to you hide any work or cover.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting technique is used on pipes that are significantly harmed, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for repairing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, which includes 2 4 foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by placing a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be impervious to root invasion for up to 100 years.</p>
