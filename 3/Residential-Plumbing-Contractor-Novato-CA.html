<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step procedure. Step, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to attaching any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it might need additional adapters, flexible tubing is far much easier to work with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the inconvenience of soldering.</p>

<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your structure needs a backflow preventer or multiple gadgets, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in very uncommon cases where the structure is deemed to not pose a danger to the supply of water, need to be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
