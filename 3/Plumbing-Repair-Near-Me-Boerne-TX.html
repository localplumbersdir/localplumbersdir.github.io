<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for many construction contractors (or their staff members). The secret to the innovation is having the ability to control both the crystal growth rate and their removal from our polymer beads, thus eliminating firmness ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not need replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," specified Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary innovation officer. This technology is more cost reliable and lasts longer than common water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>Check Valves and Dual Checks. There are two other types of backflow preventers available that you may run into. The first is a check valve. The 2nd is a double check". It is NOT the same thing as a Check despite the fact that it may be marketed as one! Don't get ripped off! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Double Checks have losses comparable to Check (5 PSI).</p>
