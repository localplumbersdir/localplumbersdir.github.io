Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
