<p>The normal service is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an alternative to think about if you reside in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for lots of years, but steel ultimately struggles with corrosion and lacks the toughness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually revealed a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
