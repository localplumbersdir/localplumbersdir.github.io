<p>A cross-connection is any long-term or temporary connection between a public water system or consumer's potable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water supply or consumer's potable water system and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly vulnerable to blockages with food and grease being the significant perpetrators. If fats are put down the sink, they harden to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls as well. Even tree roots can create severe drain blockages by twisting around pipes. Their squashing strength stops the water circulation, forcing plumbers to discover and repair the concern for typical house plumbing operations. If this is what is taking place to your home, you need your drain cleaned up before it leads to more damage and even costlier repairs.</p>
