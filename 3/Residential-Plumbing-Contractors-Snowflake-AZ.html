<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a fantastic person. He told me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) up front and provided as guaranteed. I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These costs remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay may be higher.</p>
<p>You reside in an older home. There's a good opportunity that you'll need to have it done soon if your home is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes. Galvanized pipes were most often installed in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to burst and rust when they get old. If so, you might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't already have one. This generally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
