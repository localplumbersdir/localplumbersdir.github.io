<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather reasonable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
