<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
