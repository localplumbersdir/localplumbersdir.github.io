Most of toilets are basic sized - meaning a "will fit" seat suffices for safety and convenience. Some toilets, however, have uniquely formed bowls and need a specific seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It actually isn't a great idea to use a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to small, unless they have been particularly designed to fit typical toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to slide around, or won't distribute your weight evenly and could eventually trigger fractures in the bowl.</p>
