<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Sick Of False Guarantees? Water flows in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regeneration). During this process, the resin beads are washed with the extremely focused saltwater option (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
