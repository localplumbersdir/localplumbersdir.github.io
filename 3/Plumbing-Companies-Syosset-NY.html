<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Syosset NY</h3>
<p>In water distribution systems, water is normally preserved at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might fail or be reduced when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may enable infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
