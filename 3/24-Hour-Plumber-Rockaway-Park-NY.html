<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really quickly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a complete repipe in certain communities, based upon our experience.</p>
