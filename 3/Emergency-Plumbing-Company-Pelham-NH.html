<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements might have really tight tolerances that need to be kept. An important thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the component. The guide is an extremely vital part of the design of each element. If the element is not repaired effectively, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of consistent or direct) of the element, which could trigger the part to not work to its capabilities.

For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
