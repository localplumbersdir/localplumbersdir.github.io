<p>Aside from these two important components, there are a myriad of little, maybe less important things that can break or deteriorate. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more rapidly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
