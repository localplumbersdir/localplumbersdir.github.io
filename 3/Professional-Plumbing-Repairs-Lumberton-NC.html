<p>Inspect the home's hot water heater You will be wanting to see if it is big enough to accommodate your requirements (a family of 4 must have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the hot water heater's age. Inspect to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can choose the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will mean that less water will be warmed and readily available for usage. Also, corrosion of the tank's aspects can cause the tank to have a short life. If the water heater is old or you see apparent indications of deterioration, request that a brand-new one be installed.</p>
<p>Depending upon the level of the clog, we might use a variety of different techniques, the most typical being hydro-jetting. Hydro-jetting is an advanced form of drain cleaning where we use water under high pressure to entirely clear out whatever inside your drains. Lay the garbage disposal on its side and remove the electrical cover plate from the bottom. Loosen up the green ground screw and get rid of wire connectors. Detach waste disposal unit wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen up screws on the electrical clamp port and eliminate wires from the garbage disposal.</p>
