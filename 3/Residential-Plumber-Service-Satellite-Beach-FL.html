Blanc also constructed a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be towed by a truck and featured a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning big commercial and community sewer pipes. An enhanced version called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable. It was stopped in 1973.</p>
