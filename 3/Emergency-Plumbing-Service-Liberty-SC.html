These clogs can transform into greater plumbing problems if you're not cautious.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this accreditation. I have actually checked with a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would expect the cost to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
