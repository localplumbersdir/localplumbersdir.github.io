<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial stock of backflow valves and related devices includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This results in micro-fractures and reduces the basic structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to discover.</p>
