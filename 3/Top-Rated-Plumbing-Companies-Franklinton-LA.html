Plumbing services will use more products which adds to your labor expenses.</p>
<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a viable solution, especially when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are lots of disadvantages to using these hazardous items - not least of which is that they normally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the danger of damage to your house and family.</p>
