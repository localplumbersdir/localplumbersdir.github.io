When drains are working appropriately that's actually all you need to learn about them, however when something fails, you need to have a deeper understanding of what type of problems can happen in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage.

<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not consist of blades.

When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind versus a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
