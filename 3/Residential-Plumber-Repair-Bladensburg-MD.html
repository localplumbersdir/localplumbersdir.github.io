<h3>Why Do You Need a Drain Cleaning Service in Bladensburg MD 20710?</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
