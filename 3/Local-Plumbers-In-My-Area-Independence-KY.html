<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. An important thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the element. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each component. If the element is not repaired appropriately, the guide could limit the motion (rather than direct or constant) of the part, which could trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
