<p>If you experience obstructions and backups in your house more than a few times, it's a great idea to have a professional evaluate your drain system. A drain expert like TLC will utilize a camera to examine your drain system.

<p>The great news is that it does not necessarily need a repair of your entire unit if you suspect your toilet has a leak. A toilet's tank is composed of multiple little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or fixed due to their regular usage. When these parts wear, they result in tiny leakages that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is very important to call a plumber as soon as you presume you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also cause flooding and water damage.</p>
