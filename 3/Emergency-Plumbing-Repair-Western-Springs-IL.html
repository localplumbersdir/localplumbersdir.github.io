<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, rust or collapsed pipes. House owners may have a video inspection done to discover the cause of routine sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older house.</p>
<p>Setting up a salt-based softener or water softener alternative offers much better, more secure drinking water. When showering in conditioned or softened water you will delight in much healthier skin and hair. Sewer lines that need to be replaced or repaired due to obstructions, tree roots, or other issues are typically accompanied by a range of issues such as bad smells, water backing up and bubbles coming through your drain.</p>
