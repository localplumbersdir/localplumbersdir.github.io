Sediment Accumulation: If you notice weird popping, banging, or clanging sounds originating from your unit, this could be a sign that sediment has built up in your tank, and is triggering a response with the heating aspect. Running out of hot water quickly is another sign of sediment build-up, due to the fact that the sediment is using up more space in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this issue, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
