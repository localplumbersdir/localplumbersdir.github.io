<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
