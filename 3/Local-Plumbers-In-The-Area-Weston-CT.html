<p>So, what's a backflow prevention valve? This is a device that ensures non-potable water does not return into the main supply of water system.

<p>When it comes to repiping and changing plumbing in your house, this is one of the very first and main questions that you must ask yourself. The age of your home is a crucial component to understand whether you should repipe your house. This is not only due to the fact that your plumbing has aged with time, however also due to the fact that houses that were developed before a specific time period are more likely to include galvanized steel, known to be a metal that is obsolete in the world of plumbing and beyond due to its sensitivity to rust. If your house was developed prior to the 1970s, we strongly advise that you employ a plumbing professional to inspect your house's plumbing and inspect if there are locations that need repiping. Opportunities are that your home might need substantial repiping so that your home's plumbing can work at optimum rates if your home was constructed decades before that.</p>
