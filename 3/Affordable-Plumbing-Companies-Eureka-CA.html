<p>We concentrate on storm drain inspections and cleaning. Carson, Dunlop & Associates Ltd., 120 Carlton Street Suite 407, Toronto ON M5A 4K2.

<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to get this certification. I have actually consulted a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would expect the price to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
