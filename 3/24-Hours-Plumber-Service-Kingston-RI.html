<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a practical service, especially when basic plunging does not appear to work. However, there are numerous disadvantages to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they typically consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, however at the cost of providing the danger of harm to your house and household.</p>
