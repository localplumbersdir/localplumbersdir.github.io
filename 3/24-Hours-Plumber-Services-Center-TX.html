<p>Sewer linings can help to repair split pipes without needing to completely replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them. Day to day use must not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also take place if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from occurring, install the unit in a safe and stable  place. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, secure the softener so that if the foundation starts moving, the softener does not fall over and rip out the plumbing. You need to wait until after the cycle is finished and then inspected the system for fractures or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking throughout regrowth. You need to also inspect to make sure your drain line is never ever blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
