Not just does a leaking toilet waste water, it can likewise result in flooding and water damage.</p>
<p>A drain professional will need to access the drain line from the roof vents or pull out a toilet. This is generally more labor-intensive and might need extra costs.

PEX and CPVC are both plastics and are outstanding alternatives to the pricey copper piping.</p>
