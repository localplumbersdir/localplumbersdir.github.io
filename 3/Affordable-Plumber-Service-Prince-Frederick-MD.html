He noted that there are certain impurities that locals are handling and an RO can help alleviate those concerns. Due to being mainly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of farming waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems get rid of around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally occurs in some soils and that too can be fixed with the right RO system.</p>
