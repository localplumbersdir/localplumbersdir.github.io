<p>Many homeowners believe their energy companies or homeowners insurance coverage is responsible for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, however the truth is that in many cases you, the property owner, are responsible. Most standard house owners insurance coverage and local energy companies or towns do not cover repairs to or replacement of the significant systems around your house.</p>
<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are quite popular with property owners in the area. He noted that there are certain impurities that locals are handling and an RO can help alleviate those concerns. Due to being mainly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of farming waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems get rid of around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally occurs in some soils and that too can be fixed with the right RO system.</p>
