Trenchless pipe repair is a kind of pipe repair that does not include any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair likewise known as trenchless pipe lining is a resilient and outstanding alternative for your damaged pipes. The pipe lining process includes our team saturating a felt liner with an unique resin mix. When the felt liner is totally filled, it is pressed through your pipeline. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all cracks and flaws. The liner is left to harden in place for a number of hours or 60 minutes if heat is used.
