<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely rapidly.

<p>When your bathtub drains or your toilet flushes is never an excellent sign, an unusual gurgling sound.

The majority of fire sprinkler heads, other than sprinkler heads on a deluge system are kept closed by a heat-sensitive operating system. Typically, this operating system is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  No matter the operating mechanism, just the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open throughout a fire.</p>
