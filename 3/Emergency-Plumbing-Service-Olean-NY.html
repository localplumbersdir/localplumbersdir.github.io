<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is since if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
