<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, deterioration or collapsed pipes. House owners might have a video inspection done to discover the cause of routine sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or buying an older house.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a full repipe in particular neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
