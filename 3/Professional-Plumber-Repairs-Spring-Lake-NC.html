Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from your house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, deterioration or collapsed pipes. House owners may have a video inspection done to discover the reason for routine sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or purchasing an older house.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham checks backflow assemblies upon installation and performs periodic re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies must be checked by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report need to be supplied to the City of Bellingham.
