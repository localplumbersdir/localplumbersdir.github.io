<p>You may be tempted to bond or patch a leak shut or replace just a single area of pipe to save money.

When these parts wear, they result in tiny leaks that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is important to call a plumber as soon as you presume you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet drainage, it can also lead to flooding and water damage.</p>
