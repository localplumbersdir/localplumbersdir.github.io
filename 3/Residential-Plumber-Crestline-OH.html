<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with homeowners in the area. He noted that there are certain pollutants that locals are dealing with and an RO can help relieve those issues. Due to being mostly farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of agricultural waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems remove around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic likewise naturally happens in some soils and that too can be fixed with the ideal RO system.</p>
<p>Remodeling plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest a lot more. With this method, you understand the turnkey price going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
