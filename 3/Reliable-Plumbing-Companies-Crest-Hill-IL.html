Our makers operate by snaking a turning cable television with an attached blade through your pipes. The blades will dislodge the build-up due to grease, soap, tree roots, and other foreign items.

<p>Your garbage disposal makes sure that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit includes two stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind against a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without obstructing.</p>
