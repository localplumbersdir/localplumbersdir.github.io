<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by removing hardness minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the solidity itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener option in areas where it is prohibited to use salt. Water conditioners do not successfully eliminate solidity from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
