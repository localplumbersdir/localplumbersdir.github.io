<h3>Why Do You Need a Drain Cleaning Service in Sioux Center IA 51250?</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
