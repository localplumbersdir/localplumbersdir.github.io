Picking a tank with a minimum of 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star rating is suggested. The energy effectiveness of a storage water heater is indicated by its Energy Factor (EF).

If the part is not repaired effectively, the guide could limit the movement (instead of direct or steady) of the part, which might cause the component to not work to its capabilities.
