Pipe Repair to fix your toilet concerns.

<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>When we handle your gas or gas pipe installation and gas pipe repair, you can relax and utilize your gas piping with no worry. While water overuse is an issue for your wallet, it's likewise a problem for the environment.
