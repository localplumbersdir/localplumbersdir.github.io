<p>Renovation plumbers usually charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest a lot more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey rate entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
<p>It assists to know the brand name and design of your toilet. The brand is usually on the bowl behind the seat.

Even professional plumbers often try 2 or 3 flappers before they find one that works well.</p>
