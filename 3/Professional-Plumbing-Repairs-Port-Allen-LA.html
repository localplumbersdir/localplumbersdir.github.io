<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, however likewise has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.
