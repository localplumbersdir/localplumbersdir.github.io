Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually shown a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
