The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin.

<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Castle Rock WA</h3>

Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
