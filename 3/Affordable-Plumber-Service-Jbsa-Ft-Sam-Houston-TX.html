<p>You most likely understand one thing about your drains: they take water from your bathtubs, sinks, and showers to a local water treatment facility. When drains are working appropriately that's really all you need to learn about them, however when something fails, you need to have a deeper understanding of what kinds of problems can take place in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage. That's where a professional plumber comes in-- they have the competence to detect an issue and the tools and understanding to fix it.</p>
<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
