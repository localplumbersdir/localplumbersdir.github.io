<p>When the pressure in a personal water system goes beyond the pressure in the public water circulation lines that can trigger typical flow to reverse, backpressure takes place. A pump utilized to increase the water pressure within a structure's plumbing system to reach a greater floor may trigger this. Preventive cleaning for drains should be carried out on all drains, including toilet, floor, sink and tub drains.</p>
