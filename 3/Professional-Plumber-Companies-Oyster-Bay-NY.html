<p>The more frequently a garbage disposal is utilized (correctly), the more effectively it will grind food waste and withstand rusting.

<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and an excellent guy. He informed me precisely what to expect (cost, time, process) in advance and provided as guaranteed. I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These prices remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The overall you pay might be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>

He also did the job faster than original approximated, so the work was more economical than I prepared for. I will use Gotelli Plumbing once again in the future.</p>
