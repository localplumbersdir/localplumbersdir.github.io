Due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, normally restore after many gallons of water have been softened. Such designs are practical if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
