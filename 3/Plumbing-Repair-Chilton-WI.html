<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your house, which makes its plumbing's effective functioning a need more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process.

Once the system is pressurized, air should be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system ought to be checked to make sure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close effectively. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
