Disposers can be stopped in their tracks by celery, eggshells and apple seeds, along with the normal kitchen flotsam, consisting of pop-tabs, scouring pads and twist-ties. While some older homes might not have backflow preventers, all more recent homes are required to have them. Doug's can help you find and identify them if you're not sure what kind of backflow preventers are used in your home or business. We can also perform your yearly backflow inspections.</p>
<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is very important that the repair professional knows the proper installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Most backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
