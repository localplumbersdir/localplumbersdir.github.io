<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from your house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, rust or collapsed pipes. House owners might have a video inspection done to find the reason for routine sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or purchasing an older home.</p>

<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
