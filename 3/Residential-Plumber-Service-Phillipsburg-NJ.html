That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer system computes the amount of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration immediately starts. For a three-bedroom house and family of 4, regrowth typically occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>Keep in mind: Difficult water stops your washing detergent from working successfully because difficult water ions can bond with detergent molecules to deactivate them. You, for that reason, have to use increasingly more cleaning agent to accomplish the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Tough minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and decontaminated throughout regeneration. Lastly, water containing the difficult minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
