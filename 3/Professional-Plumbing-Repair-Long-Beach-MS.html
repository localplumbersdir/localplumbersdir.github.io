It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company because they had fantastic evaluations and a reasonable cost, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent job tidying up after it as well.</p>
