When drains are working properly that's actually all you need to learn about them, but when something fails, you need to have a deeper understanding of what sort of problems can happen in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage. That's where a professional plumber is available in-- they have the know-how to diagnose a problem and the tools and knowledge to fix it.</p>

This is in addition to any interior gas lines or extensions that need to be set up.
