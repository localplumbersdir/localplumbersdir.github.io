<p>Carbon monoxide gas is launched when gas burns incompletely. The signs are the very same as direct exposure to gas leak. The direct exposure to carbon monoxide gas is so fatal that anyone who inhales it needs immediate medical attention. The Centers for Illness Control and Prevention revealed that 5149 people died from carbon monoxide gas poisoning in between 1999 and 2010. To avoid this disaster, make certain to use your gas stoves precisely as advised and never to use them to heat your house. The same goes for portable gas ranges, which are to be used outdoors just and not inside your home. When running the space-heaters, make sure somebody is awake to monitor them.
