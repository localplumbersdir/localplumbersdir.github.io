<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, carefully lift the rod and listen. You might be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Flex the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. Make sure it's adjusted appropriately (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not need to clear the tank to make these changes.</p>
