Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
