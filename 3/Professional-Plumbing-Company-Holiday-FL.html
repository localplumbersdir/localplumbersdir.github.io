<p>One typical method for a house's water supply to be polluted is if the irrigation water lines, which might end up being polluted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. The issue could spread tremendously if that infected water were to backflow into the community drinking supply. A backflow preventer not only secures drinking water in specific residences, it likewise avoids wastewater in private houses from receding out and contaminating the general public water supply.</p>
<p>For example, a plumber on an online forum sponsored by tool producer Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of clearing out a sewer line with a cable and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done individually. And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut begin at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for as much as two hours and $175 per hour for each additional hour.</p>
