<h3>Three Ways To Find An Emergency Plumber Near Me Muscatine IA</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your structure needs a backflow preventer or multiple gadgets, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in very rare cases where the structure is considered to not pose a danger to the water supply, must be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, in addition to a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
