<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is very important that the repair technician understands the correct installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Most backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Regrettably, main line obstructions are not something a homeowner can fix.
