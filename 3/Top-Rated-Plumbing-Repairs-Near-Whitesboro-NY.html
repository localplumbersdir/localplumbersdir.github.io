The repair may be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
