Galvanized pipes were usually set up in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to rust and burst when they get old. You may need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one if so. This normally includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
