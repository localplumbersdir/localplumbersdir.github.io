<p>You live in an older house. There's a good possibility that you'll need to have it done soon if your home is 50 years old or older and you have actually never changed its pipes. Galvanized pipes were usually set up in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to rust and burst when they get old. You may need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one if so. This normally includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>

The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly.</p>
