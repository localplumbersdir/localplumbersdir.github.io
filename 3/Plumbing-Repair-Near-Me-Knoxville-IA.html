<p>All piping under faucets and sinks are looked for leaks or damage. How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we recommend having them changed immediately. Before you can ask for an inspection, you should initially obtain the required license( s) for the work you plan to do. You can have a look at our Permit page for additional information on obtaining an authorization. Once you obtain a license you can start with the work. However, you need to require inspection before you hide any work or cover.</p>
