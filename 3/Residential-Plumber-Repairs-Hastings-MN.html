<p>If the hot water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is an indicator the tank is stopping working and will need to be replaced. Schedule a price quote as soon as possible and guarantee nothing is near the heater that might be potentially damaged if it is in a garage and a small sluggish leak. Leaking hot water heater can burst causing water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
