<p>Inspections avoid a high percentage of plumbing emergencies. There are some things you can do for your hot water heater to help it run effectively. It is important to make sure there is always two feet of clearance around it. You need to also drain about 25 percent of your tank routinely (a few times each year). This will help get rid of any sediment that has actually settled inside the tank.</p>

<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
