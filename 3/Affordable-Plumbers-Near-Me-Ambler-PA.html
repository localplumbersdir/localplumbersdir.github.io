Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they must be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
