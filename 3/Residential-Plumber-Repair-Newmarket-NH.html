Local plumber priced estimate cost of $400 to install plus cost of waste disposal unit. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ delighted I checked around.

<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends on the extent of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>

The unique nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all directions to enable the water to cover the whole size of the sewer line and supply a mindful cleaning.</p>
