<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is generally made of aluminum or magnesium and remains as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can draw in the irons that would typically trigger rust. After extended usage, these rods will ultimately become worn out and need to be changed.

<p>The typical plumber's per hour wage is $68-$ 138. Sometimes basic repairs, such as unclogging a toilet or a drain, will have a repaired rate of about $220 unless there are extenuating circumstances. The cost to snake a drain is from $3-$ 13. Some plumbers will charge a cost to look at your situation and inform you what needs to be done, but if you hire them, that charge will be subtracted from the expense. A plumber might charge $50-$ 100 to diagnose the problem and come. 2 Needing to call a plumber after hours, on the weekend, or on a vacation will cost more.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you very first try using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. Many of these cleaners consist of focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely hazardous if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these items, please make sure to take the appropriate safety measures.</p>
