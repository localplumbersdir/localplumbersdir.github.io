<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts.

The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a very crucial part of the style of each component. If the element is not repaired appropriately, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than direct or constant) of the component, which might cause the component to not work to its capabilities.

In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
