<p>E.R. Services understands the importance of preserving the integrity and effectiveness of your kitchen. Sediment Accumulation: If you notice weird popping, banging, or clanging noises originating from your system, this could be an indicator that sediment has developed in your tank, and is triggering a reaction with the heating aspect. Lacking hot water rapidly is another indication of sediment build-up, because the sediment is taking up more space in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>

<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
