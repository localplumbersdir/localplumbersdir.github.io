Galvanized steel (frequently recognized merely as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is fairly pricey, and tough to work with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It remains in typical usage for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building code non-combustibility requirements normally discovered in hotels, apartment and other commercial applications.
