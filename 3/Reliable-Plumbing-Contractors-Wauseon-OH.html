<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The water system line feeds the difficult water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household devices. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to explain an unfavorable flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water brings pollutants back to the main water system system, making the water in it unsafe to consume.</p>
