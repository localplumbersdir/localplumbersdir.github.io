<p>Depending on your situation, your plumber may utilize one or a mix of piping material throughout your house repiping task. Copper is standard due to the fact that it's long-lasting, can make it through fires, and withstands weather condition. However, copper is challenging to install, which means higher labor expenses. PEX or polyethylene pipes have the benefit of flexibility, which suggests plumbers can flex the pipes removing the need for joints, which saves time and money and lowers the risk of joint leakages. PEX also withstands deterioration and freezing better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will choose which material is best depending upon your needs.</p>
