<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing acclaimed acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from the house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, rust or collapsed pipes. Property owners may have a video inspection done to find the reason for routine sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older house.</p>
<p>When a faulty gas line or device leakages natural gas, gas, or carbon monoxide, a natural gas leak takes place. Gas leaks happen both in and beyond the house or business.

A toilet's tank is composed of several little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or repaired due to their frequent use. When these parts wear out, they result in tiny leaks that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is very important to call a plumber as soon as you presume you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet waste water, it can likewise result in flooding and water damage.</p>

The repair may be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.
