<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
