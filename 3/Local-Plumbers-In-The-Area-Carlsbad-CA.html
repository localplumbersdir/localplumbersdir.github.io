<p>The trick to preventing a clogged waste disposal unit is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there ought to be no concern in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food items you ought to probably not take into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another suggestion to stop clogging is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are finished cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>
