<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is generally made of aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can attract the irons that would generally trigger rust. After extended usage, these rods will eventually end up being worn out and need to be replaced. If you do not replace them, you could experience major problems with your hot water heater really rapidly, not to mention finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
<p>The source or location of a sewer problem determines who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another.
