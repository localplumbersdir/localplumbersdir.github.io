<p>Inspect the house's hot water heater You will be seeking to see if it is huge enough to accommodate your requirements (a family of four should have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the water heater's age. Check to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will suggest that less water will be heated up and available for usage. Likewise, deterioration of the tank's aspects can trigger the tank to have a brief life. Demand that a new one be installed if the water heater is old or you see apparent indications of corrosion.</p>
<p>3. Think about a hair-stopper: The number 1 reason our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning experts are called into a house is because there is too much hair in the shower drain. Hair-stoppers are quite inexpensive and simple to install, so there's no reason not to. When grease strengthens it sticks to the pipe and prevents water flow, eventually triggering a backup. This included with other debris in your drain can cause a major backup.</p>
