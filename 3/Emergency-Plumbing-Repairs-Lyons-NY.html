<p>A total repipe of a house's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and detailed plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole house repiping.

<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the ideal length for your brand-new disposal.

<p>Light Blue = Lowered Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Inspect spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
