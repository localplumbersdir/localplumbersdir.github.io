<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
