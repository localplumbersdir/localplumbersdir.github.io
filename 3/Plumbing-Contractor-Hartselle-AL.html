When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regrowth). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the highly concentrated saltwater service (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank).
