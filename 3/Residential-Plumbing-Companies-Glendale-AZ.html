<p>Filtration in sink taps and fridge water dispensers improves water's taste, but its steep price makes it unwise as a household service. Packaged chemicals soften water in little batches, such as washing machine loads, but render the water undrinkable, take a toll on clothes, and, in some cases, contain phosphates that damage the environment. A clogged sewer pipe could leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning rip-off.</p>
