<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of 2 categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on an established schedule and then return to service. These work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt because they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not.

Such models are convenient if you have a changing water use schedule.</p>
