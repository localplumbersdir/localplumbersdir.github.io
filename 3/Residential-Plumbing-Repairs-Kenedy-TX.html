<p>The secret to preventing a clogged waste disposal unit is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at an affordable amount, there must be no concern in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food items you must probably not take into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another suggestion to stop clogging is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are ended up cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>
