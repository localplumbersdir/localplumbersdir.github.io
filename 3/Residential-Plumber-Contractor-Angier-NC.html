<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
