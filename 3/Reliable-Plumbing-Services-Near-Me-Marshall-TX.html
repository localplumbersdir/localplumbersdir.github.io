<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is because if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
