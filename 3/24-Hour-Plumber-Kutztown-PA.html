<p>Handheld sprayer. Leakages can in some cases develop on the water lines for handheld sprayers that are connected to the kitchen sink. If the leak is far enough down the water line, water will drip into the cabinet beneath. A reduced pressure backflow preventer is the top of the line when it pertains to backflow preventers, and is the device of option because it can endure the introduction of fertilizer or other chemicals, it's also a sensible choice for residential water supply.</p>
