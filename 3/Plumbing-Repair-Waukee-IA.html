<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic rust Direct contact between different metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed because of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
