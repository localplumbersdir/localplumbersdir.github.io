<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by getting rid of hardness minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from developing by neutralizing the hardness itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are often thought about a greener option in locations where it is prohibited to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not effectively eliminate solidity from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
