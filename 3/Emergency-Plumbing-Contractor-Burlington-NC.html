<h3>Handheld Replacement in Burlington North Carolina</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason we will recommend a complete repipe in certain areas, based on our experience.</p>
