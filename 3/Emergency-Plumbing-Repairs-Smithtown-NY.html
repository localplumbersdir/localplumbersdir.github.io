<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and costly plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire house repiping. Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were remarkable. My 90 year old Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos reached 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the home and location of the pipe, it was a tough job. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
