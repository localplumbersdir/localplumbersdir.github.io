It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut down remains in the closed position.

A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical areas in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will build up.</p>
