<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply.

Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
