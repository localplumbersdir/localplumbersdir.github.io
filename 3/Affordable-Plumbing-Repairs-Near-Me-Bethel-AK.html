<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there will not go through.</p>

<p>Changing the old disposal with a similar new one is less complex than changing with a various design. So, if you are not looking particularly for a different disposal this may be something to think about. A completely various disposal, or for installing your first disposal, the sink connector has to be puttied into place. A safe and secure seal is a must. Once connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher adapter is attached.
