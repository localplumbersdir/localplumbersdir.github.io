<p>Plumbing contractors who want to run their own plumbing company may think about finishing a postsecondary company degree program. Although these programs are not a requirement for plumbing contractors, they can offer the advanced knowledge and skills necessary for those who want to end up being successful business owners and small company owners.</p>
<p>The next requirements to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is important that the repair professional understands the appropriate installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Many backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is essential that the assembly just be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
