The majority of commercial usage backflow prevention setups make use of a valve system that connects with the watering line within your service, where watering meets the main supply of water. From here, the preventer can keep track of the movement of water within your system, and avoid any potential back-pressure and back-siphonage that might be caused by malfunctioning plumbing equipment.
