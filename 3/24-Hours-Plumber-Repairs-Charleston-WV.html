<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and pricey plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole house repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 year old Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos reached 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the house and location of the pipe, it was a tough job. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working prior to they left. I am really grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
