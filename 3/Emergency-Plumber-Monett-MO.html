Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to function at its best.</p>
