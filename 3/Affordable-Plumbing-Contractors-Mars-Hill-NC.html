The system chosen for a given installation must be appropriate for the system design and site conditions, consisting of consideration of whether back siphoning or backpressure is most likely to take place. Further, it should be installed in accordance with plumbing codes, manufacturer requirements, and engineering guidelines for the type of unit to be used.</p>
