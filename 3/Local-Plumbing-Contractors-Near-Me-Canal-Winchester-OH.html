<p>Quality sinks effectively set up last for years, so we're normally called in for kitchen and bath remodels. However with discolorations or scratches in a kitchen sink along with cracked or split porcelain in bathroom sinks lots of property owners choose a sink installation alone. Sinks and fixtures may also develop drain problems that require a sink repair. Bathroom sink repairs also consist of adjusting or replacing the pop-up stopper assembly.</p>
<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information implies for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
