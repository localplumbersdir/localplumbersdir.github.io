<p>If you have an older house, there's a likelihood you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing the end of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to wear away. This corrosion can lead to an accumulation of lead, which can have many negative impacts on your health. Rusty pipes likewise lead to poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>If your pipe is failing; one is to repair the bad connection that is triggering a stoppage, with PVC you have a couple of choices. The other is to go on and replace the whole line. Definitely replace if the line is about 40 years old and is showing indications of age throughout. These days, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based on the condition of the line, it may be an acceptable choice to do simply that. However, if the offset worsens trenchless might no longer be an option.</p>
