<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Wyoming MI</h3>
<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic deterioration Direct contact between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is developed since of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
