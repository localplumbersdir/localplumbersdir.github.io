<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (typically recognized just as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is fairly costly, and challenging to deal with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It stays in typical usage for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building regulations non-combustibility requirements normally discovered in hotels, apartment and other commercial applications.
