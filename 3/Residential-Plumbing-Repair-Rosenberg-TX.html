<p>You count on your drains to carry wastewater from your shower, tub or sink. Over time, the drains become clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These materials collect in the drain and ultimately harden against the pipe walls, making them difficult to get rid of. Your hot water heater is leaking: Water heater leaks are among the most typical signs that your unit is at completion of its life expectancy, particularly if they are triggering significant flooding or are originating from the tank itself.</p>
