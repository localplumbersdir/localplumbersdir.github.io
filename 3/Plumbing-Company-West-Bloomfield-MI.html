<p>The source or place of a sewer issue determines who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (generally 10 feet broad) where main sewage systems pass through personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>When the pressure in a personal water system surpasses the pressure in the public water distribution lines that can trigger normal flow to reverse, backpressure occurs. A pump utilized to increase the water pressure within a structure's plumbing system to reach a greater floor might trigger this. Preventive cleaning for drains ought to be performed on all drains, including toilet, tub, floor and sink drains.</p>
