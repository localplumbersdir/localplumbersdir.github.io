<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the most part, a garbage disposal is just equipped to manage softer natural waste.

Nevertheless you risk of damaging the motor or blades.</p>
<p>Replacing the old disposal with an identical new one is less complex than changing with a various design. So, if you are not looking specifically for a various disposal this might be something to think about. An entirely different disposal, or for installing your first disposal, the sink port needs to be puttied into place. A secure seal is a must.
