All replacements must be installed to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the proper type of assembly based upon the conditions on your property (see section listed below "Needed Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Additionally, the assembly should fulfill the lead free requirement of Area 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the 30 days, all water services will be ceased until the assembly is in compliance.</p>
<p>Outdoor plumbing for clogs or leaks. After checking everything inside, your pro will then check the outdoor plumbing.

It is recommended that you have the garbage disposal changed if problems end up being more frequent with an older system.

The repair might be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
