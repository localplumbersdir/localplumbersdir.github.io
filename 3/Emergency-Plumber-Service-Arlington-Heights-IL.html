<h3>Main Sewer Line Replacement in Arlington Heights Illinois</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in certain communities, based upon our experience.</p>
