Homeowners can just unscrew the aerator screen from the faucet to clear out minerals or other deposits. If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way, water pressure can likewise be low.</p>
<p>Colored water-- If your hot water appears rusty, this might be a sign that your water heater is rusting on the within and might start leaking soon.
