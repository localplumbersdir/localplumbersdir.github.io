<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is actually a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk situations is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
