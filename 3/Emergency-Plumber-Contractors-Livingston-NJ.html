<p>3. Solar Salt originates from evaporated seawater and may in some cases leave a pink "bio-film" or stain in tubs and sinks. The pink movie is actually a harmless bacteria that comes from the sea salt. If this stain is an annoyance in your home, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) advises switching to one of the other 2 types of salts. Once the new salt has had an opportunity to entirely replace the solar salt in your system, then buy some water softener filter cleaner to clear out your softener as advised in your owner's handbook or on the cleaner label.</p>
