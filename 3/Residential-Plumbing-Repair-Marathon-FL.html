<p>Backflow preventers are a relatively simple system, regardless of their significance. Most of commercial use backflow prevention setups make use of a valve system that gets in touch with the watering line within your company, where irrigation fulfills the main water supply. From here, the preventer can monitor the motion of water within your system, and prevent any possible back-pressure and back-siphonage that may be caused by malfunctioning plumbing equipment.
