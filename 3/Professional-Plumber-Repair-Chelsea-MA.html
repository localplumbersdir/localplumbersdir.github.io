Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure.

<p>If you have an older house, there's a great chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to wear away. This rust can result in an accumulation of lead, which can have many unfavorable effects on your health. Corroded pipes also cause poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
