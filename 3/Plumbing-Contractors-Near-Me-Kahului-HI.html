<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements may have really tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An essential thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is a very vital part of the style of each element. If the part is not repaired appropriately, the guide might limit the movement (instead of steady or direct) of the component, which might trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
