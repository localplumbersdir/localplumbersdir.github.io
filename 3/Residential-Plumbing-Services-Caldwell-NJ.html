<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
