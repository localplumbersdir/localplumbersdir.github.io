If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, secure the softener so that if the structure begins moving, the softener doesn't fall over and remove the plumbing. You need to wait until after the cycle is finished and then checked the system for fractures or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking during regeneration. You ought to also inspect to ensure your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
