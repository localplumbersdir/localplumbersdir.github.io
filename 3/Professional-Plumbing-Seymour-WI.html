<p>The good news is that it doesn't necessarily require a repair of your whole unit if you presume your toilet has a leak. A toilet's tank is composed of numerous small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or fixed due to their frequent usage. When these parts wear, they result in small leakages that are tough to see with the naked eye. This is why it is necessary to call a plumber as soon as you suspect you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet waste water, it can likewise lead to flooding and water damage.</p>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not really the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
