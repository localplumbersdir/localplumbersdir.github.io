<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Per Hour Andover MN</h3>
<p>The most efficient way to deal with difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Water softeners usually have a life expectancy of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last much longer if they are effectively preserved. Ensuring the salt water tank never runs out of salt will extend the system's life.  Protecting the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also safeguard the unit. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange performance. Resin cleaners boost the regrowth cycle and assistance alleviate the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
