<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
