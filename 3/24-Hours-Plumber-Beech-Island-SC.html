<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
