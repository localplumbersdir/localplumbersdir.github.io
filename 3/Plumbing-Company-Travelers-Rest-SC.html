<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
