A bad plumber can be your worst nightmare in terms of problems that keep returning to bite you.</p>
<p>Improvement plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest far more. With this method, you know the turnkey cost going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
