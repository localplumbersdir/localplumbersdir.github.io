<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have very tight tolerances that need to be preserved. A crucial thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the part. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each component. If the element is not fixed properly, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of direct or stable) of the element, which could cause the component to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
