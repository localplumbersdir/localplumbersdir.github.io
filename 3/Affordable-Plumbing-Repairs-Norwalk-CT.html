It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I selected this company because they had great reviews and a fair rate, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great task cleaning up after it also.</p>
