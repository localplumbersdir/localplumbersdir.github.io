The repair might be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
