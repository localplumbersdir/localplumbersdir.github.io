If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>

Merely put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while.

Many of these cleaners include concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very harmful if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs.
