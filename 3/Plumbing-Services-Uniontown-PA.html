<p>Many property owners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to resolve their unclean or clogged drain concerns. These chemicals are simple to use and inexpensive, but they damage your pipes and their effects are only short-term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners use severe chemicals to eat away at the clog and with repeated usage, these chemicals will also gnaw at the pipe producing vulnerable points that are vulnerable to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always recommended.</p>
<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a practical option, specifically when easy plunging does not appear to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous disadvantages to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they normally include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the threat of damage to your house and household.</p>
