<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

Utilizing the images recorded by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
