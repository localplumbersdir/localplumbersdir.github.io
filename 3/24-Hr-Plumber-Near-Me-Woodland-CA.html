Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they should be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
