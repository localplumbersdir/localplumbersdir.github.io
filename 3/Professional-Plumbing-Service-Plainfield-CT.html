The factor you can feel the distinction on your skin is because soap reacts with the calcium to form soap scum. This leads to the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. Which's where the term hardness" originated from ... it's tough to wash in.</p>

<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener quantity of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
