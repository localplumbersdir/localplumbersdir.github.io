<p>Waste disposal unit clogged or broken? Whether you need repairs or replacement, we've got you covered in the Cincinnati area. Garbage disposals are designed to work in one of two methods. Either through what's known as a batch feed, where the unit is filled, then covered before it is turned on, or through a continuous feed, where the unit can be filled while it is running.</p>
<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is typically made from aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can attract the irons that would typically trigger rust. After extended usage, these rods will ultimately become worn and need to be replaced. If you do not replace them, you might experience significant problems with your hot water heater extremely rapidly, not to point out finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
<p>Whether you have a garbage disposal and it's not working correctly, or if it's finally time to install one in your home, a garbage disposal is a previous high-end that is nearly a requirement in these times. Always continue to run water during and after using your disposal. Ideally, flushing it with cold water for 30 seconds after the waste has actually disappeared down the drain.</p>
