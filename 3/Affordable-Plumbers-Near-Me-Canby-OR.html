<p>The purpose of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to guarantee that all plumbing installed throughout building and construction of a new or refurbished building is set up by educated craftsmen in accordance with relevant codes.

When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the meals, or pour flat soda in your sink, you typically understand your drain is clogged and requires cleaning. However, when a clogged drain emerges through flooding, the clog is probably in the draining pipes component itself. Blockages in a fixture can trigger destructive damage to your draining pipes system the longer they persist.</p>

No matter what kind of sink you need serviced, Candu can help you find a local plumber to fix, install, or replace it.</p>
