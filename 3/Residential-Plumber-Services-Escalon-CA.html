<p>We all experience a clogged drain eventually. You can try to take matters into your hands by using everyday items, such as a plunger, a coat hanger, or a snake. Some house owners will attempt to dislodge the clog using store-bought drain cleaners and natural home remedies, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda. These remedies do work, particularly if you are dealing with a little drain clog. However, they are generally short-term fixes that do not offer permanent resolutions.</p>
