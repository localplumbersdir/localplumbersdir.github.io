<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place.

Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly created and set up to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
