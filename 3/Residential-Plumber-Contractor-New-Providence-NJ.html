<p>Backflow means the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they need to be thoroughly created and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for installing backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Standard for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Security Systems for carrying out annual forward flow tests are in some cases viewed as a mandate to have them. But the intent of the code is to just attach installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers exist.</p>

<p>Some softeners deal with electricity, however some more current water softeners use waterpower.
