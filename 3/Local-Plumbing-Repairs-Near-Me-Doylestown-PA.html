<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most intricate and costly plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole home repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were remarkable. My 90 year old Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. Because of the age of the house and place of the pipe, it was a difficult job. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
<p>Include more hot water if it slowly recedes as you work. Keep plunging until the drain is clear or you choose it's time to try a new approach. Tankless systems link directly to your plumbing and only heat the water as it is needed. This results in savings on your energy bill.
