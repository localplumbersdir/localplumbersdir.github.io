<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Use an option of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear. We advise natural products, such as Bio-Clean, since they work much better than products consisting of extreme chemicals and won't trigger damage to your drains or components.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another technique is to present a chemical substance that functions as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and remain suspended in the water rather than building up on surfaces. Nevertheless, if they stay in one place for long, as they might in a water heater, the buildup might still happen.</p>
