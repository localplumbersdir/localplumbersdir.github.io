Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will wear away.

The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a water resistant membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>

<h3>Clogged Drains Driving You Crazy Never Call The Emergency Plumber Again Owens Cross Roads AL</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
