<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
