<p>Depending upon your circumstance, your plumber may use one or a mix of piping material during your home repiping job. Copper is basic because it's long-lasting, can make it through fires, and resists weather. Nevertheless, copper is challenging to install, which indicates higher labor costs. PEX or polyethylene pipes have the advantage of versatility, which suggests plumbers can bend the pipes removing the need for joints, which conserves time and money and decreases the danger of joint leakages. PEX also withstands corrosion and freezing better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will choose which material is best depending on your requirements.</p>
