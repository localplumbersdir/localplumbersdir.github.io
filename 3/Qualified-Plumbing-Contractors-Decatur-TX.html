<h3>Hydro Scrub Jetting in Decatur Texas</h2>
<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Your existing garbage disposal is likely a continuous feed design. This is found in a lot of homes and is what lots of people think of when they begin looking for a new device.
