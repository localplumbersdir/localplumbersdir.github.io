<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
