<p>In this situation, unclean water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You likewise need to invest in a backflow valve if you discover your water has an unusual flow, smell, color or taste. A plumbing professional can identify whether the problem with your faucet is a quick fix or the result of other issues in your home's plumbing system. More complicated issues with water temperature level or pressure may require replacing the hot water heater, which usually costs $350-$ 3,500, depending upon capability and type.</p>
<p>The normal service is to have the defective pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is a choice to consider if you live in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing.
