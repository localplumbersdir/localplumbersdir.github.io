<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the tough water is softened. The water supply line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household home appliances. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to describe an unwanted circulation of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water carries impurities back to the primary water supply system, making the water in it risky to consume.</p>
