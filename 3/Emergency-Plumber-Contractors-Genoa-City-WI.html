<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is needed.

The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
