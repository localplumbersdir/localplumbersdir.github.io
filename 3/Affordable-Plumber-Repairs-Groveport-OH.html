Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed since of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>

While ineffective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve immediately ahead of the RPZ will typically hold the pressure consistent to the assembly in times of changing supply pressure.</p>
