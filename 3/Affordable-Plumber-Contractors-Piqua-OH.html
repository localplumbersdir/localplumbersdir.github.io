<p>Water softeners, like the CareSoft Pro, work by eliminating an abundance of calcium and magnesium from water. Sediment from these components not only dry your skin and hair but likewise build up in pipes and appliances reducing their effectiveness and life span. Your washing machine, dishwasher and water heater are all adversely affected by tough water. The impacts of tough water can be seen on your dishes, the color and softness of your clothing, the film on your shower door and even your personal appearance and comfort.</p>

Hard minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and disinfected throughout regeneration. Finally, water containing the tough minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
