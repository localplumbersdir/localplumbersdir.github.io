Examine to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will imply that less water will be heated and readily available for usage. Likewise, corrosion of the tank's elements can trigger the tank to have a short life. If the water heater is old or you see obvious indications of corrosion, request that a brand-new one be set up.</p>
