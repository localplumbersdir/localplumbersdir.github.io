When the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process.

When the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are totally open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>

<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test data means for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
