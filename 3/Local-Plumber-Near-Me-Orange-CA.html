<h3>Blocked Sewer in Orange California</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason we will suggest a full repipe in particular communities, based on our experience.</p>
