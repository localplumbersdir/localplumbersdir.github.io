<h3>Plumbing Repairs & Services In Fort Mohave AZ</h3>
<p>These guys were incredible! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for several years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I selected this company since they had fantastic evaluations and a reasonable cost, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great job cleaning up after it also.</p>
