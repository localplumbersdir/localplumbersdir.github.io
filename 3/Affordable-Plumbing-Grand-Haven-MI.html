<p>A. If you have rust spots, utilizing phosphoric acid generally will help remove them. If you wish to attempt the gentlest method possibly attempt using some Coke on the rust initially.  No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola includes a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke. Wipe with a soft fabric and after that more Coke, over and over, and so on. Then utilize Naval Jelly which includes a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to check out the instructions and security cautions first!), if that does not do the trick. Naval Jelly is what we here at ® use to get rid of rust discolorations and it's easily offered at a lot of hardware shops.</p>
