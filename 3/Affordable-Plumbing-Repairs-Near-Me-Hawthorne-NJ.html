<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were developed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water became basic. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This deterioration, or rust, triggers the iron to inflate and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a water resistant membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>

As helpful as this gas is, the functions that make this gas unsafe is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a quiet killer. Nevertheless, to prevent off that danger, mercaptans are added into natural gas, which offers it a rotten egg smell and makes it detectable when leaking.
