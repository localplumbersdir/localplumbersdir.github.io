<p>Likewise called a garbage disposer, a waste disposal unit comes in 2 basic types - continuous feed, which typically has a wall-mounted switch so the unit keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which requires a food cover be in place to run the system. Continuous feed is common and the easiest to utilize; a batch feed model is more secure but can be slower to utilize on big amounts of food waste because you have to process it in batches. An Ohio plumbing supply company offers a summary of garbage disposal types and styles.</p>
