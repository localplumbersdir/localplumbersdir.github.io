<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
