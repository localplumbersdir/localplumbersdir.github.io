<p>Form Growth: Mold growth is another regrettable side effect if you need a sewer line repaired. When you also have an odor of sewage along with it, this is most typical. The mold growth would most likely be behind your walls but will start to permeate through in time. You will probably see a white residue on your wall near an area where a sewer pipe is located.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
