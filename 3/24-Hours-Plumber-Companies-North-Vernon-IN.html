When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regeneration). Throughout this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly concentrated saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>
