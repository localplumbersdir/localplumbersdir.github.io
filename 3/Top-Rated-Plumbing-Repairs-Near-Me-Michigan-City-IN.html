<h3>Quality Plumbing Services In Michigan City IN</h3>
<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has frequently been misconstrued as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due mainly to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to consumer misconceptions about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening merely gets rid of hardness minerals and removes problems that are a problem and not a threat to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal preference not requirement. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and drawbacks, that make this choice a significant one.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
