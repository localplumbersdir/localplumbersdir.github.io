<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both.
