<h3>Necessary Plumbing Services From Plumbing Contractors Longmeadow MA</h3>
<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves must prevent backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand operated valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
<p>The most common method for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a process in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another element, typically salt. Salt will not cause lime scale or soap scum buildup like other minerals do, and water softening adds only an extremely percentage of salt to your water. According to the Mayo Clinic, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of sodium, which is thought about extremely low sodium" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
