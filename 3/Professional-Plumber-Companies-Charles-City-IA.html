<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
