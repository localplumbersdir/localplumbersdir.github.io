<p>When repairing the pipe is the more feasible choice, there are lots of circumstances. For instance, if you are experiencing a one-time water leak, fixing the concern is the better option.

<p>Backsiphonage can occur when there is an unexpected decrease in the water pressure of the circulation system, such as throughout fire combating or when a water pipe breaks.
