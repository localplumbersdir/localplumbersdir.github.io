<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair split pipes without having to entirely replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Daily usage should not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also happen if you run into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from taking place, install the unit in a safe and steady  area.

If your water softener is leaking throughout regeneration, you must wait till after the cycle is completed and then examined the system for fractures or broken fittings. You must also inspect to make certain your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
