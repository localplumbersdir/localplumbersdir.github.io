<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is very low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an incredibly pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of circulation in a potable water circulation system. Water that is constantly under pressure can only flow in one instructions. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will always stream towards the point of lowest pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened numerous fire hydrants to help fight a fire, the pressure in the water main could drop. The demand upstream might cause a reversal in flow.</p>
