<p>The most reliable way to address hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>The cost to replace pipes under the house is simply the cost to install a new plumbing system which can vary from $2,000 to $15,000 or more. You can install new copper pipes for $3 to $8 per linear foot, or $0.40 to $0.50 per direct foot for PEX hose. Pipes do run under homes, sometimes in concrete. It is quite common to leave the old pipes in location after disconnecting them. The new pipe is merely set up in the course of least resistance. Depending upon the style of your house, the pipe can be set up in the attic or under a crawl space.</p>
