<p>Keep in mind: Hard water stops your washing detergent from working efficiently due to the fact that tough water ions can bond with detergent molecules to deactivate them. You, therefore, need to use more and more cleaning agent to attain the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution.
