<p>Some makers declare that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually shown a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not truly the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there will not go through.</p>
