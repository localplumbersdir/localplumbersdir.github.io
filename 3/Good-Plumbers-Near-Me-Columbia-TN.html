In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a complete repipe in certain areas, based on our experience.</p>

<p>A kitchen sink repair is a typical problem in many residential houses. It is among the most used plumbing fixture that with time if not looked after might trigger a big problem at the owners expense. As seen on the above photo, there are numerous parts to a kitchen sink.

<p>The pipe-bursting technique is used on pipes that are badly harmed, for changing an entire pipe system, or for repairing bigger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes two 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by positioning a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be resistant to root invasion for as much as 100 years.</p>
