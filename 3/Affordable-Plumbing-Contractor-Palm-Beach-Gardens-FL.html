<p>Backflow means the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they should be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
<p>The toilet tank fills with water after being flushed. The pipe is insulated according to code to prevent winter freezing. The new pipe, made from a modern, crosslinked polyethylene, is fed down through the walls. Some drywall and wall product are removed to attach the pipes to the water components, Wood states. Depending upon the scope of work being carried out and the kind of structure, you may have one or more inspections.</p>
