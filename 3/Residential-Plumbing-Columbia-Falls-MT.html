<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high danger" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction.
