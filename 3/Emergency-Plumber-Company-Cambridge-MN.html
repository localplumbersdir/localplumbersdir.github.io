Most of commercial usage backflow prevention setups utilize a valve system that gets in touch with the irrigation line within your service, where watering meets the main water supply. From here, the preventer can keep track of the motion of water within your system, and avoid any potential back-pressure and back-siphonage that might be caused by malfunctioning plumbing devices.
