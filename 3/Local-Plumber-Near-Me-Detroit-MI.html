<p>The calcium from limestone is the significant contributor to the hardness of Woodbury's water. Firmness can appear as a problem when water is boiled or dried from a drip since it forms a white powder residue when all the water evaporates. It also interferes with soap and cleaning agent usage. People with really soft water can use smaller quantities of soap and cleaning agent for washing.</p>
<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are set up in locations where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
