<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber West Jefferson NC</h3>
<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has actually often been misconstrued as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due mainly to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to customer mistaken beliefs about water treatment.
