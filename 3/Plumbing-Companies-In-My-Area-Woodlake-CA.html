<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Woodlake CA</h3>
<p>These guys were fantastic! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had terrific reviews and a fair cost, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic task cleaning up after it also.</p>
