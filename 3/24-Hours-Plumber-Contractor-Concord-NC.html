<p>The most reliable method to address tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>You hear water dripping or running in the tank. When water runs backwards through your pipes and into the drinking water system, a backflow happens.
