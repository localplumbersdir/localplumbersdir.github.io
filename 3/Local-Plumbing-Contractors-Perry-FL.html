<p>The pipe-bursting technique is used on pipes that are significantly damaged, for changing an entire pipe system, or for fixing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, which includes two 4 foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by placing a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be invulnerable to root intrusion for as much as 100 years.</p>

Before you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
