It is very tough to judge such claims, which are almost never based on tests that are well sufficient described to allow others to examine them and to confirm the results. While the lack of "clinical" proof does not in itself revoke a claim for the efficacy of a device, it should make one hesitate to accept it without some warranty of performance.</p>
<p>This is constantly the # 1 top priority for any genuine professional. Plumbing can be a harmful job, and can negatively impact everyone living in the house when completed poorly. There is particularly no exception for dealing with toilets. If poorly managed, your toilet's ineffectiveness might cause burst pipes, supported sewer lines, and even increased toxicity in the area. Obviously, most of those situations are just results of cases of severe disregard, but you can never ever be too mindful with the plumber you choose. Make sure you pick a plumbing company with a track record for safety.</p>
