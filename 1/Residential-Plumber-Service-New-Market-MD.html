Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 year old Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. Since of the age of the house and location of the pipe, it was a difficult job. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>

In some areas of Virginia, where the water is specifically difficult with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater more frequently.</p>

<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
