I selected this company because they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable price, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic task cleaning up after it also.</p>
