<p>It is not always due to blockages that originate inside the house when drains are clogged. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, also referred to as tree root invasion. When tree roots begin to make their way inside someone's main sewer line, there is capacity for this to trigger drain problems. The type of drain pipes already installed, such as cast iron, clay, plastic or copper, will figure out the degree of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>
<p>However, the majority of the time, it's safe to say that any repairs that need to be finished will come out of the pocketbook of a house owner. Plumbing Codes and State law dictate minimum requirements for backflow prevention. Public water systems such as the City Utilities Department need to fulfill or surpass the state requirements and bring the responsibility for implementing them.</p>
<p>A garbage disposal lasts approximately 10 to 12 years. This typical life-span computation assumes normal wear and tear of the unit.
