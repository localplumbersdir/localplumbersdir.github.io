<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

With toilets, the pro will check water levels, flappers, and filler mechanisms. He or she will eyeball noticeable pipes, and may run a camera inspection to inspect the pipes' condition from the within.</p>
