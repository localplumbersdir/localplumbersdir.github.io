<p>If you discover yourself continuously jerking the flush lever to try to stop your toilet from running, it's time to employ among our licensed Columbus plumbers to help you in finding the leak or broken component and fixing it. Grease: Never put grease, fats, or oils down your kitchen sink. Rather than removing, these materials often harden to form nasty obstructions, which you might need a plumber to get rid of.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you think a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: spray a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, examine to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually altered color. If it has, you more than likely have a leak.</p>
<p>Soap - Soap develops down the drain due to the fact that they normally consist of grease and fat. When the fat of the soap integrates with mineral water, it sticks and forms a strong residue to the pipes, obstructing them.

Tough water causes these issues due to the minerals in the water that are left behind after a wash.
