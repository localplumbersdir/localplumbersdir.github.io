<p>When it comes to repiping and changing plumbing in your house, this is one of the first and main questions that you should ask yourself.

If your home was built prior to the 1970s, we strongly recommend that you employ a plumbing professional to examine your home's plumbing and inspect if there are locations that need repiping. Chances are that your house might need extensive repiping so that your home's plumbing can work at optimum rates if your home was constructed years prior to that.</p>
