<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
