<p>With PVC you have a couple of options if your pipe is failing; one is to repair the bad connection that is causing a stoppage. The other is to go on and replace the entire line. Certainly replace if the line is about 40 years old and is showing signs of age throughout. These days, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based upon the condition of the line, it may be an acceptable choice to do simply that. Nevertheless, if the balanced out worsens trenchless might no longer be an alternative.</p>
