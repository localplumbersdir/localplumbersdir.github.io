<p>The very best source for this type of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's concealed; you don't get that chance. In addition, your contractor understands the indications of quality work that you might miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, effectively sized holes in joists, floorings, and studs. Lastly, a quality contractor will not threat dealing with a shoddy plumber. An easy error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily ravage $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and make complex the task with insurance coverage claims, lost time, and lawsuits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with only the very best.</p>
<p>So now that you understand you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Sadly, main line clogs are not something a homeowner can fix. This type of clog needs a professional plumber or drain specialist to utilize a drain cleaning machine to locate the clog and get it cleared. TLC can utilize a camera to see down into the drain line and find the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this type of camera to repair the drain and determine issue. If you have a long sewer line from your home to the sewer system or septic system, this type of camera is specifically useful in finding an issue.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
