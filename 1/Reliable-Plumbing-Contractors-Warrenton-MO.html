<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some components might have really tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An important thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is an extremely vital part of the design of each component. If the element is not repaired properly, the guide could limit the motion (instead of consistent or direct) of the component, which might cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
