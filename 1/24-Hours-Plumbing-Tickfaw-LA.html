<p>Tom of Gotelli Plumbing provided superb service for us in replacing a really balky tub spout, and broken toilet parts. Not only was he very professional and comprehensive but he was able to address all my questions worrying the service. If I could, I would give 6 stars. A video camera inspection of your sewer line is one of the most efficient ways of locating the precise location of a plumbing problem. A plumber will place a specifically created waterproof camera through your sewer line and capture live footage to figure out where and what the source of the issue is.</p>
