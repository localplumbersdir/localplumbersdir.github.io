If a clogged storm drain is not dealt with in a prompt manner, the chances are high that it will trigger additional damage to the storm pipe, which will require repair.</p>
<p>Damage control is a problem. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I run into circumstances, on a regular basis that need a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the task.

I 'd like to publish some images of this. Just look on line. The problem does exist.</p>

<p>Food scraps compose as much as 20% of all household waste. If it can easily and rapidly be disposed of through the sink, this big quantity of garbage does not need to go in the garbage can. A waste disposal unit works by shredding the waste into tiny pieces that are capable of taking a trip through the sewage pipes without impeding water flow. By installing a garbage disposal you are helping the environment by saving the quantity of garbage that gets sent to landfills and other dumping areas. With a waste disposal unit the trash is handled through currently existing water infrastructure.</p>
