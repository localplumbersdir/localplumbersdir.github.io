Instead, our service technicians utilize a breaking tool that requires the existing pipeline to burst" and disintegrate.

This repair technique is generally utilized to replace the old pipe with a comparable or bigger pipe.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting approach is used on pipes that are badly damaged, for changing an entire pipe system, or for repairing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, which includes two four foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by positioning a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be resistant to root invasion for up to 100 years.</p>
