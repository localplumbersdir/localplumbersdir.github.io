<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and costly plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole house repiping.

It was a difficult task because of the age of the house and area of the pipe. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
