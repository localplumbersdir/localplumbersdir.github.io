<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk situations is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
