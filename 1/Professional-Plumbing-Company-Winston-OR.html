Running out of hot water quickly is another sign of sediment build-up, due to the fact that the sediment is taking up more space in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>
<p>No hot water-- The lack of hot water is the greatest sign that there is something wrong with your San Antonio water heater. You may have sediment that has built up in the system and separated the water from the heat source if you aren't getting enough hot water for your shower.

<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
