<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to collect your yard. Throughout a camera inspection, a sewer and drain service technician runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images recorded by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in areas where the ambient temperature level is maintained at or above 40 ° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water streams right away from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times.
