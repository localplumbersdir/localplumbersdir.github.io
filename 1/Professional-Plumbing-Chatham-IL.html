The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regeneration).

The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY task. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Repair: Any concern including the flush handle usually consists of a repair that plumbers can perform easily.
