<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. The professional shut off the supply of water and loosened up the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor. He was then able to remove the pipe to clear the clog and reattach the pipe to the toilet component. The customer helped our specialist in moving the toilet back into its appropriate area, and the service technician tightened the bolts before restoring the supply of water and making sure that the toilet was effectively flushing.</p>
<p>One of our numerous professional services at Ryan's Plumbing is toilet repair. A clog or leak in a toilet can trigger water damage to your house if not repaired rapidly.
