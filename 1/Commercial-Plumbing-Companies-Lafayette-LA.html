<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
