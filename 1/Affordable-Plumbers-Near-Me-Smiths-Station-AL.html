<p>Galvanized steel safe and clean water supply and circulation pipes are commonly found with nominal pipe sizes from 3⁄8 inch (9.5 mm) to 2 inches (51 mm). It is seldom used today for brand-new building and construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (typically known just as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is reasonably expensive, and difficult to work with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It remains in typical usage for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building code non-combustibility requirements generally found in hotels, apartment and other commercial applications.

<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on an established schedule and after that return to service. These work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt due to the fact that they regrow whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, normally regenerate after many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are convenient if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
