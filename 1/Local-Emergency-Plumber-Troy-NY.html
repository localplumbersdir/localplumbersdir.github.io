<p>One typical way for a home's supply of water to be infected is if the watering water lines, which could end up being polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. The issue might spread out tremendously if that polluted water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply. A backflow preventer not just secures drinking water in specific houses, it also prevents wastewater in private homes from flowing back out and infecting the general public water system.</p>

The CareSoft ® system was established with the same innovative engineering as the Pro and Elite designs, with resin that delivers high-performance solidity removal you can count on for years to come.</p>
