<p>Natural gas is the one we are most closely exposed to. This gas is used for heating our homes, for lightening our ranges, and for running home appliances such as hot water heater.

As beneficial as this gas is, the features that make this gas dangerous is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a silent killer.
