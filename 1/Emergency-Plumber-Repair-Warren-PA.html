Constant feed is common and the easiest to use; a batch feed model is more secure but can be slower to utilize on large amounts of food waste since you need to process it in batches. An Ohio plumbing supply company provides an overview of garbage disposal types and styles.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be triggered due to buildup and grease within the system. Snaking the drain will not fix the issue if this is the case.
