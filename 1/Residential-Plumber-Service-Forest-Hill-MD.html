<p>The source or area of a sewer problem identifies who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (usually 10 feet broad) where main sewers pass through private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a means or system to avoid backflow. The standard means of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The basic mechanism for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The primary types of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly.</p>
