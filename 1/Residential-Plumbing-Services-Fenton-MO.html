<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Fenton MO</h3>
<p>The most effective method to address difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Soft water is readily available 24 hr a day, 7 days a week, even during regeneration. Running toilets can be the result of a corroded overflow pipe, worn out flush valve assembly, or broken flapper valve. Offer the experts at Roto-Rooter a call to repair your running toilet and reduce wasted water. Backflow prevention systems are devices installed onto a pipe that just allow water to stream in one direction.</p>
