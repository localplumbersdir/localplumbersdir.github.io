<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
