<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. As soon as the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Sadly, main line clogs are not something a homeowner can fix.

All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this kind of camera to repair the drain and recognize problem.
