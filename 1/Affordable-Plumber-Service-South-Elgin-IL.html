<p>When drains are clogged, it is not always due to blockages that stem inside the home. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, also known as tree root intrusion. When tree roots start to make their way inside someone's main sewer line, there is potential for this to cause drain problems. The kind of drain pipes already installed, such as cast iron, clay, plastic or copper, will identify the level of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>

Must you encounter a specialized faucet repair that needs special order parts, we can put the order and get the sink fixed as soon as the part shows up.

If you live in an earthquake-prone region, strap the hot water heater to the wall with unique straps (Fig. A; readily available at plumbing stores and home centers). Your plumbing inspector will inform you if they're required.</p>
<p>Typically brought on by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then check and see if you see coloring in the bowl.
