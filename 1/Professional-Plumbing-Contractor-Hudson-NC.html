In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly.

The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high danger defense assembly.</p>
