<h3>Plumbing - Leaky Faucets and Water Waste in Ypsilanti MI 48197</h3>
<p>First consider your alternatives if you are looking to replace an existing underground sewer pipe that has actually begun to leak. A complete sewer pipe replacement may not be required.

<p>A. Normally wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
