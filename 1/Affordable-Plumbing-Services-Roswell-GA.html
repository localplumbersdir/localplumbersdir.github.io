<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply.

Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
