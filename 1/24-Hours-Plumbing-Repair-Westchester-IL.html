<p>Unless you have a crafty two-year old who enjoys to throw toilet tissue down the toilet, you must not have regular obstructing concerns. In fact, you should rarely have a clogged toilet if you are utilizing it effectively and if it is working appropriately. If you are having a toilet that blocks constantly and in need of toilet repair from Vegas Valley Plumbing on a regular basis, then it's probably time for a brand-new toilet.

<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
