<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are quite popular with property owners in the area. He kept in mind that there are certain pollutants that locals are handling and an RO can assist ease those concerns. Due to being mostly farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste.

Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Bend the float arm if there is no modification screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's changed properly (Photo 8). You don't need to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>

Within the City of Seattle only, anybody who installs gas piping on home not under their ownership should possess a Seattle Gas Piping Mechanic License. All gas piping installations need a permit and inspection.</p>
