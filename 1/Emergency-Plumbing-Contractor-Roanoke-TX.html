<p>Changing your sink is a detailed process. Measure, cut, and connect the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the system to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used.

<p>When the components are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback shut off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to move to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air must be gotten rid of from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from critical areas in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be utilized to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will collect.</p>
