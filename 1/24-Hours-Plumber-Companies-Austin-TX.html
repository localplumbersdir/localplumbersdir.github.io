Design - Once you add a second floor and even 3rd floor, pipes need to be run up to it. This is more complex than plumbing the ground floor and is more labor intensive. Plumbing services will utilize more materials which adds to your labor expenses.</p>
<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
