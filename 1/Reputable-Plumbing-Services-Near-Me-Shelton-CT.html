<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are installed in areas where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

<h3>When To Call A Plumber Shelton CT</h3>
<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves must prevent backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually run valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
