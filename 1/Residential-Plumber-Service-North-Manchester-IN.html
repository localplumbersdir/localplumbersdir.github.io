The minerals that cause hard water adhere to the beads, and the cured water heads out into your home's plumbing system.</p>
<p>Water supplied by the public utility contains some quantities of hazardous chemicals like arsenic and lead. Water filtration systems remove these impurities to make drinking water clean, clear and tastier. As such, water filtration systems are essential requirements, not optional expenses. A home plumbing inspection will either be visual, made with a camera, or a mix of both.</p>
