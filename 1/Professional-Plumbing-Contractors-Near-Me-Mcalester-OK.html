Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
