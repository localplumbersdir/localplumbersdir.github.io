<p>Examine the house's warm water heater You will be seeking to see if it is huge enough to accommodate your needs (a household of four must have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the water heater's age.

Mineral deposits can decide on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will suggest that less water will be warmed and readily available for usage. Likewise, deterioration of the tank's components can cause the tank to have a brief life. Request that a brand-new one be installed if the water heater is old or you see apparent signs of corrosion.</p>
