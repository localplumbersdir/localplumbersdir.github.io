<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the public water system and personal on-site water supply and distribution systems by prohibiting cross-connections in between potable (appropriate for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by needing installation of primary and secondary backflow prevention techniques.

<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. As soon as the resin beads end up being loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
