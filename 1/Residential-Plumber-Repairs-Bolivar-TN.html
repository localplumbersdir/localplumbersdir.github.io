<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds an extremely focused solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand contributed to the brine tank in the type of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is reducing, the heavy salt water option is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the salt water tank lacks salt, the water travelling through the unit will no longer be softened.</p>
<p>Today's high-efficiency softeners are altering the economics of water softening in the carwash market. Traditionally, the savings have actually been based mainly on lowering chemical and cleaning agent expenses. While those savings are still substantial, brand-new commercial softening technology using multi-tank systems (MTS) also provides substantial water and salt savings.</p>
