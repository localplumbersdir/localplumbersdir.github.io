<h3>How Often Should Plumbing Check West Olive MI</h3>
<p>In water distribution systems, water is usually preserved at a significant pressure to enable water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may be or stop working reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water supply (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may allow polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>Whenever the pressure on the residential or commercial property (downstream) side goes beyond the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. Nevertheless, while DCV systems are considered safe for most fire protection systems, they do have a defect: if both valves fail or particles in the water line prevents them from closing totally, backflow can happen.</p>
