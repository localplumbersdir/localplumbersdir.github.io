Oftentimes, individuals pick to soften just the hot water.</p>
<p>It typically symbolizes rust and mineral buildup if you observe low water pressure or discolored water. As rust and minerals build up in time, they restrict the circulation of the water which is why you may discover lower water pressure.

Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can become a health danger in your water.</p>
