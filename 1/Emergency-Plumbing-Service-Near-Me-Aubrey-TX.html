Running out of hot water rapidly is another sign of sediment accumulation, because the sediment is using up more space in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this issue, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>

Like any other system that receives frequent, ongoing usage, your home's pipes undergo routine wear and tear. Eventually, these pipes will need to be replaced altogether.
