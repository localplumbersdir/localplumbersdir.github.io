Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
