InSinkErator is the world's most popular waste disposal unit brand with average costs varying from $80 to $283. One of their best low-cost garbage disposal choices is the Badger 5 for $85.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to acquire this certification. I have actually contacted a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the price to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
