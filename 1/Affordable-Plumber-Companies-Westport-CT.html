<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components might have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is an extremely important part of the style of each element. If the part is not fixed correctly, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of constant or direct) of the element, which could trigger the component to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
