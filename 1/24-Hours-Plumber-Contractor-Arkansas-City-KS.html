<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is very important that the repair service technician understands the correct installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Most backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
