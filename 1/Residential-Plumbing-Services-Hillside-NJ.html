<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive stock of backflow valves and associated devices includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and reduces the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and might stop working without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Improper installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to spot.</p>

Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
