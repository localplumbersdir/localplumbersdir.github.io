It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company because they had great reviews and a reasonable cost, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific task cleaning up after it too.</p>
