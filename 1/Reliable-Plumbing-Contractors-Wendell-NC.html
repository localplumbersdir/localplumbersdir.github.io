<h3>How To Avoid A Drain Plumbing Emergency Wendell NC</h3>
<p>These men were incredible! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had excellent evaluations and a reasonable price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific task cleaning up after it too.</p>
