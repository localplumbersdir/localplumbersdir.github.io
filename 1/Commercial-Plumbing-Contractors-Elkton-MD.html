<p>You reside in an older house. There's a great possibility that you'll need to have it done quickly if your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never changed its pipes. Galvanized pipes were usually installed in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to burst and wear away when they get old. If so, you may need to add a grounded outlet to power the waste disposal unit if you do not currently have one. This generally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not include blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit includes 2 stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind versus a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without obstructing.</p>
