<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some components might have very tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An important thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is a really crucial part of the design of each component. If the element is not repaired appropriately, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than steady or direct) of the component, which might trigger the part to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
