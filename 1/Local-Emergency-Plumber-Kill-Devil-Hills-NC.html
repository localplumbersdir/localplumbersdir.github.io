<p>A general rule is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span. If, say, you need a new burner package and the water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes good sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more uncertain the economics of a repair ends up being. The factor is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>
