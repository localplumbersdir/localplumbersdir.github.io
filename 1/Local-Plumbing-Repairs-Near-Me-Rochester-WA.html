<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive stock of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Improper installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to identify.</p>
