Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
