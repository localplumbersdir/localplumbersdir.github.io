Sediment Accumulation: If you notice weird popping, banging, or clanging noises originating from your unit, this could be an indicator that sediment has actually built up in your tank, and is causing a reaction with the heating element.

<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a fantastic guy. He informed me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, process) up front and delivered as guaranteed.
