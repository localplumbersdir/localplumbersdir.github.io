It has 2 spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.

This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
