<p>Changing the old disposal with a similar brand-new one is less complicated than changing with a various design. So, if you are not looking specifically for a different disposal this may be something to consider. A totally different disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink port needs to be puttied into location. A safe and secure seal is a must. As soon as connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher connector is attached. The last thing is to wire up the new disposal, making sure to connect wires accurately, and the base covered to secure the electrical wiring from any water getting in.</p>
<p>Though it's not always essential, in some cases the plumber may have to repair or update electrical wiring to power the brand-new waste disposal unit. This generally costs an additional $50 to $100+. The pilot burner may need to be relit, the gas line might be clogged or need repair. If the gas line is damaged, the flowers or vegetation near the gas leak will be blemished or deteriorated. Contact our professionals to identify the level of the issue.</p>
