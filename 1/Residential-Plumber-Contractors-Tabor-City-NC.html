<p>Chelation: Another technique is to introduce a chemical substance that acts as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and remain suspended in the water instead of developing on surfaces. Nevertheless, if they stay in one place for long, as they may in a water heater, the buildup could still occur.</p>
