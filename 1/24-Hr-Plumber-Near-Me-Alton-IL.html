<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Alton IL</h3>
<p>The most effective way to deal with hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>This is very crucial! When you have actually cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to push the waste out of your drain system. Existing regulations limit the amount of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave particles piling up in cast iron drain lines.
