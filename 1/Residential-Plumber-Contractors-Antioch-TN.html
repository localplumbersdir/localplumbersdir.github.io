<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components may have very tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the element. The guide is a really important part of the design of each element. If the part is not repaired effectively, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than direct or constant) of the component, which might cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
