<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly.
