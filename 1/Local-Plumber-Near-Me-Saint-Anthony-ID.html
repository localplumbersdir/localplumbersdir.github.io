<p>If the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan, a rule of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair. If, state, you need a brand-new burner package and the water heater is five years old, then it makes good sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more skeptical the economics of a repair becomes. The factor is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>
<p>For nonemergency tasks-- a remodel or therapeutic deal with your plumbing-- you need a pro who comprehends residential-system style and knows the code in your area. He likewise has to be able to work in a finished environment. That means putting down a piece of scrap carpets to secure floors and cutting exact, easy-to-repair holes in walls, and, then, only when required.</p>
