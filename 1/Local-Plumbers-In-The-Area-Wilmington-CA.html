<p>You can use a wire coat wall mount by correcting it if you don't have a plumber's snake. Naturally, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it may be long enough to reach some obstructions. If you can reach it, insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
<p>The best source for this type of plumber is a basic contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered up; you don't get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor knows the indicators of quality work that you may miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, properly sized holes in joists, floorings, and studs. Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk dealing with a substandard plumber. A simple mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly ravage $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floorings and complicate the job with insurance coverage claims, lost time, and suits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to only the very best.</p>
<p>If you own a service or handle a commercial structure, you are aware of just how serious commercial plumbing concerns can be.
