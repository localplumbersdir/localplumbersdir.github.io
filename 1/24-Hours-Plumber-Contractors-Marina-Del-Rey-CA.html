It has 2 spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.
