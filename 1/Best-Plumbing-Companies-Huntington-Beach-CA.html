<p>Your garbage disposal makes sure that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, waste disposal unit do not consist of blades.

This high-speed action successfully pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>
