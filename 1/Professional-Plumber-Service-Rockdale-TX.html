<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
