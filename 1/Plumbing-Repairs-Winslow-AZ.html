<p>All piping under sinks and faucets are looked for leakages or damage. How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them changed right away. Before you can ask for an inspection, you need to first get the needed permit( s) for the work you intend to do. You can have a look at our License page for more details on acquiring an authorization. As soon as you get a license you can start with the work. Nevertheless, you must call for inspection prior to you conceal any work or cover.</p>
<p>Drain blockages in bathroom sinks can occur over time from the accumulation of hair, littles soap and fibers from towels that accumulates within pipes. As a clog becomes bigger over time, it obstructs the pipe, stopping water from draining correctly.
