<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. CenterPoint Energy's Home Service Plus offers you an optional Pipe Defense Prepare for just $3.95 a month. It covers interior, easily available, natural gas pipes ranging from the gas meter to your gas devices. Auto-reverse setting: Some garbage disposals come with this setting, which reverses the direction the blades spin to clear waste. This protects the blades so they do not break as fast.</p>
<p>Traditional tank water heaters: These heaters use electrical power and gas for fuel. They can heat up anywhere from 20 to 100 gallons of water at a time. These units are less cost-effective than contemporary tankless heaters.
