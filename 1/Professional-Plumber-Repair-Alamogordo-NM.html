<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits surrounding to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly concentrated option of salt (or sometimes potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually contributed to the brine tank in the type of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is decreasing, the heavy brine option is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
