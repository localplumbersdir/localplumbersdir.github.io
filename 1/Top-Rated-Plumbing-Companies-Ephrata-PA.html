<p>Gently raise the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. If the water shuts down, you might have the ability to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no adjustment screw, bend the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's adjusted appropriately (Photo 8). You do not need to clear the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
