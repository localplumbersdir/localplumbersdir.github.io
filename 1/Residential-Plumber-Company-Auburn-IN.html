Due to the truth that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener option in areas where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently eliminate hardness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
