<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest far more. With this method, you know the turnkey rate going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>Gas lines inevitably need repairs-- age and use will ultimately use them down. Though typical, it's still stressful to a property owner, who may fear the inconvenience of hiring a service professional to handle their (potentially) costly repairs rapidly and efficiently. That's what Mr. Rooter Plumbing is here for. Our inspections make sure you are aware of every prospective gas line problem, and our repairs make sure your system is working completely again.</p>
