<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the extent of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet.
