<p>If you do not have a plumber's snake, you can use a wire coat hanger by aligning it. Of course, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it might be long enough to reach some obstructions. If you can reach it, insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or pull out the clog. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to collect your lawn. During a camera inspection, a sewer and drain technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images caught by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
