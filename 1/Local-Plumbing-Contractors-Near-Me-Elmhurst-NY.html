<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Elmhurst NY</h3>
<p>These men were incredible! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had terrific evaluations and a fair price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent task tidying up after it too.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
