<p>It prevails for water heaters to leak due to varying pressure, and the temperature and pressure relief valve belongs to the system for that precise factor.

He also got the job done faster than original estimated, so the work was cheaper than I anticipated. I will utilize Gotelli Plumbing once again in the future.</p>
