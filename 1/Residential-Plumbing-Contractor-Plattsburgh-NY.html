<p>Your storm drains do not go straight into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is normally transported somewhere else to a nearby treatment plant, a creek, and even the ocean in.

Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason why we will advise a complete repipe in particular neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
