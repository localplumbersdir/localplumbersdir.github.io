<p>The program accomplishes its mission by providing for the adoption and promulgation of suitable rules and guidelines for the construction of plumbing centers where mandated. Cold showers? High energy expenses? It may be time for a brand-new hot water heater. But in order to profit of a brand-new energy-efficient home appliance, you'll need to have it set up correctly. A water heater that is not installed correctly can lead to water damage, scalding temperature levels, and even a fire. That's why installation is best left to professional plumbers who know the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham checks backflow assemblies upon installation and performs periodic re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies need to be tested by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report should be offered to the City of Bellingham.
