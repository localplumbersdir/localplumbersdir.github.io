<p>Sewer lines have one crucial function: carry wastewater out of a home or structure. A lot of folks replace their hot water heater due to bad efficiency, complete failure or as a preventive step. It's time to think about changing it with a more efficient model if your water heater is more than 10 years old. Water on the floor can mean used parts.
