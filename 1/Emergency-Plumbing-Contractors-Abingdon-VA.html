When tree roots begin to make their way inside someone's main sewer line, there is capacity for this to trigger drain problems. The kind of drain pipes currently set up, such as cast iron, plastic, copper or clay, will determine the extent of the damage that tree roots can cause to a sewer line.</p>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
