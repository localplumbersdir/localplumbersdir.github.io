<p>To identify if your house is a poly home," start with the exterior. Underground water mains are usually blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is usually 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Regularly, it gets in the house near the hot water heater. Your main shut off is connected to the end of the water main. Make sure you examine both ends of the pipe. We have actually found cases where the copper pipe gets in the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>You might have heard stories about a warm water heater taking off inside a home or company! It is important to understand that a plugged temperature and pressure relief valve on your water heater can turn your hot water heater into an unsafe time bomb. The age of your water heater. A standard tank water heater generally lasts anywhere from 8-12 years before requiring a replacement, while a tankless hot water heater can last up to 20 with correct maintenance and care. If your unit is getting up there in age, it may be best for your long-term expenses to replace it now.</p>
