<p>Aside from these two important elements, there are a myriad of little, possibly less critical things that can break or weaken. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in good shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
