<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your house, which makes its plumbing's efficient working a necessity more than a need. When the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on extremely slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air should be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system ought to be checked to make sure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close correctly. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
