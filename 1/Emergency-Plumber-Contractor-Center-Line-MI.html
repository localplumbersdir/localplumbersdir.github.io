<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual service is to have the defective pipes changed. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an alternative to think about if you reside in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for lots of decades, but steel eventually suffers from rust and lacks the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

The deal with individual mains usually takes one to two weeks, and service work usually takes an extra one to two weeks, though some might be carried out simultaneously on a task. Nevertheless, the gas to your house will just need to be shut off for a short period of time (typically less than 4 hours).</p>
