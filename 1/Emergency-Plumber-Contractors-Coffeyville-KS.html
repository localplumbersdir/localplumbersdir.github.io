<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Plumbers repair and install water, gas, and other piping systems in services, homes, and factories. They install plumbing components, such as toilets and bathtubs, and appliances, such as dishwashers and water heaters.

<p>Horseshoe Bay houses and services may have several locations requiring backflow preventers. Our most typical applications in Horseshoe Bay are listed here. The system chosen for a given installation needs to be suitable for the system design and site conditions, including consideration of whether back siphoning or backpressure is most likely to take place. Further, it needs to be set up in accordance with plumbing codes, producer requirements, and engineering standards for the type of unit to be utilized.</p>
<p>A. Typically wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
