Storage tank water heaters are frequently discovered in many houses. Their parts are an insulated tank, usually holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and shop the water up until it's needed. A pipe emerges from the top to deliver hot water to its destination, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>
