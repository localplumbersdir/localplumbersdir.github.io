<p>A total repipe of a house's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and expensive plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire house repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were remarkable. My 90 year old Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos reached 8am the next day to repair. It was a challenging job due to the fact that of the age of your home and location of the pipe. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am really grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
