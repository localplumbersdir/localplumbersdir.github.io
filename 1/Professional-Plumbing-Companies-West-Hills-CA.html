<p>An odd gurgling sound when your bathtub drains or your toilet flushes is never ever a great indication.

A lot of fire sprinkler heads, other than sprinkler heads on a deluge system are kept closed by a heat-sensitive operating mechanism. Typically, this operating system is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  Despite the operating mechanism, only the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open during a fire.</p>
