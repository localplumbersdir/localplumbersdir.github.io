Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will mean that less water will be warmed and offered for usage. Likewise, rust of the tank's components can cause the tank to have a brief life. Demand that a new one be installed if the water heater is old or you see apparent indications of deterioration.</p>
