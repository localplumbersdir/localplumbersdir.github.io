<p>You count on your drains to bring wastewater from your shower, sink or tub. In time, the drains end up being clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These products collect in the drain and eventually harden versus the pipe walls, making them hard to get rid of. Your hot water heater is leaking: Water heater leaks are one of the most common indications that your system is at completion of its life-span, especially if they are causing major flooding or are originating from the tank itself.</p>
<p>There are various causes for obstructions depending upon where they happen in your plumbing Toilets clog from excessive toilet paper for the many part.
