<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>The types of backflow preventers the company offers include double check valve assemblies, double check detector assemblies (including stainless-steel designs), and minimized pressure zone assemblies. Suggestion: If the disposal has a line to the dishwasher, remove the plastic drain plug (or "knockout") from the disposal inlet prior to mounting the disposal. Also connect the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet when you attach the P-trap.</p>
