<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first try utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that does not work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Many of these cleaners include concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very hazardous if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please ensure to take the appropriate safety measures if utilizing among these products.</p>
