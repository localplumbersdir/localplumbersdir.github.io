<p>When pipes stop to work correctly, wastewater that needs to flow out of your house might flow back in, trigger home damage and prevent your devices from operating.

<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. When the resin beads end up being full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
