<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future.
