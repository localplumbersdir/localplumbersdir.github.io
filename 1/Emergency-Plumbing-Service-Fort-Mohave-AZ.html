Individuals typically pick to soften showers, sinks, and laundry hookups. Toilets, hose bibs, basement sinks, and other cold water taps usually do not need to be connected to a softener.

<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
