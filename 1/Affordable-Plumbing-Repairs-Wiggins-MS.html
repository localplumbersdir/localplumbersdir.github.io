<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Services in Wiggins</h2>

<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were developed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being standard. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This rust, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a water resistant membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
