<p>A general rule is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span. If, state, you need a new burner package and the water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself.
