<p>When the components are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback shut off stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in a precise movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air should be removed from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from important locations in the assembly.
