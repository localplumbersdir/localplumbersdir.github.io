<p>Aside from these two crucial parts, there are a myriad of small, possibly less critical things that can weaken or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more quickly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
