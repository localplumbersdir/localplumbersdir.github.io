<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were developed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water ended up being standard. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
