<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is actually a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk situations is because if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.
