Plumbing inspections ensure that water systems in buildings are linked correctly, with no cross-connection to contaminate drinkable water supply. Components must be effectively trapped, to prevent sewer gas from leaving into a buildings. Hot water heaters are also examined to ensure that they have been set up appropriately, to avoid a surge.</p>
