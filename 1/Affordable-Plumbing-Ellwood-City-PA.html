The brand-new pipe, made from a state-of-the-art, crosslinked polyethylene, is fed down through the walls.

<p>There's a good chance you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they start to wear away. This corrosion can result in a buildup of lead, which can have lots of negative effects on your health. Corroded pipes also lead to bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
