<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a fantastic man. He told me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) in advance and provided as assured. I will definitely use Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay might be higher.</p>
<p>There's a great possibility you have galvanized pipes if you have an older house. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to rust. This corrosion can result in a buildup of lead, which can have lots of negative impacts on your health. Rusty pipes also cause poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>For example, a plumber on an online forum sponsored by tool manufacturer Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of cleaning out a sewer line with a cable television and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done separately. And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut begin at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for approximately two hours and $175 per hour for each additional hour.</p>
