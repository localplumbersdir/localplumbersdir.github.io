Invasive tree roots can cause major plumbing problems, specifically in older neighborhoods with clay sewer lines.</p>
<p>It typically symbolizes rust and mineral accumulation if you discover low water pressure or blemished water. As rust and minerals develop in time, they restrict the circulation of the water which is why you may observe lower water pressure.

Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can become a health threat in your water.</p>
