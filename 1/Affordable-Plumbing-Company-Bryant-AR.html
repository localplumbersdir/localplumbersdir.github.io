<p>How to install or replace a garbage disposal. Sewer lines can stop working for a variety of factors, including bad soil conditions, clogs from grease and gunk, and corrosion.

In the cold Colorado winters, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be twice as intensified if pipes have actually been allowed to freeze.</p>
<p>Throughout sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates service technician inserts a high-resolution camera with a light connected to it into the sewer line at your residential or commercial property. The camera is by hand manipulated on a versatile rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor. The high-resolution light provides a clear image for the specialist to accurately analyze conditions and detect the performance of the pipes. The information we obtain from the inspection allows us to make a notified choice regarding the condition of your pipes and suggest the best service as well.

<p>There are a couple of options when it comes to repairing a broken or stopping working sewer line. The ideal choice for your home will depend on a few elements, including the age of your existing pipes, the level of damage, and your spending plan.

A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals.
