<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and an excellent person. He informed me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, process) up front and delivered as assured. I will definitely use Clog Dawg once again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These prices are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The total you pay may be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>Your expenses also will include your plumber's charge for eliminating your old disposal and linking the new one. Most plumbers charge by the hour, so any problems that crop up will increase the cost. Any damage to you old disposal or connection site might impact the time it takes. Due to the fact that carbon monoxide gets released into the air while burning natural gas, these types of heaters can result in a substantial amount of pollution.</p>
