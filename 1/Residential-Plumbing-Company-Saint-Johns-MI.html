<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water system. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
