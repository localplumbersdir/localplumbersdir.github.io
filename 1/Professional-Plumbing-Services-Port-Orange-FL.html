<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the tough water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
