<h3>How To Pick Good 24 Hour Emergency Plumbers For Pipe Video Inspections Pismo Beach CA</h3>
<p>To determine if your house is a poly home," begin with the outside. Underground water mains are usually blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is usually 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Regularly, it goes into the house near the water heater. Your main shut off is attached to the end of the water main. Ensure you check both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe goes into the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Was your home constructed before the 1970s and has not gone through improvement or pipe replacement? It is likely that your pipes are made of galvanized metal or another product which has actually rusted and decayed over the years if so. Older pipes can cause major leakages and even contaminate your water as they decay. Even the highest quality pipes will not last forever and will need to be changed.</p>
