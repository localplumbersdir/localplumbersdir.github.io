<p>Aside from these 2 important components, there are a myriad of little, possibly less important things that can degrade or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more rapidly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to function at its best.</p>
