<p>A total repipe of a home's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and costly plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger an obstruction or can trigger deterioration that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Sound-- With time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets difficult and removes from the capacity of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>
