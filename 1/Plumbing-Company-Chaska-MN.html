It's important to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt a properly operating RPZ assembly to regularly release small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in areas based on water damage. Appropriate drainage should likewise be provided.</p>
<p>Is your home 50+ years old? Up through the mid-twentieth century, galvanized steel was the main material used in plumbing. While galvanized steel is strong, it generally succumbs to deterioration after about 50 years and requires replacement.

The backflow prevention assembly need to be taken apart and parts replaced with original factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly must be evaluated again to be sure it was appropriately fixed. Comparing the test results from the repaired backflow prevention assembly to the producers flow chart is needed to guarantee it was repaired appropriately.
