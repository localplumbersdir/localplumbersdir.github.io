<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason we will suggest a full repipe in specific areas, based upon our experience.</p>

<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services Waterford MI</h3>
<p>All of us experience a clogged drain at some point. You can attempt to take matters into your hands by utilizing daily items, such as a plunger, a coat wall mount, or a snake. Some house owners will attempt to remove the clog utilizing store-bought drain cleaners and natural natural home remedy, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda. These treatments do work, especially if you are handling a small drain clog. However, they are usually short-term fixes that do not use permanent resolutions.</p>
