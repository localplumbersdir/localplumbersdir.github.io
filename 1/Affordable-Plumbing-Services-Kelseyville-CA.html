<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a great guy. He told me exactly what to expect (cost, time, procedure) in advance and provided as promised. I will certainly use Clog Dawg again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay may be higher.</p>
<p>You reside in an older house. If your home is 50 years old or older and you have actually never changed its pipes, there's a great chance that you'll need to have it done quickly. Galvanized pipes were frequently set up in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are known to burst and wear away when they get old. You might need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one if so. This normally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
<p>A leak in a single pipe can easily be repaired by changing that area of damaged piping. However, when the issue is discovered in pipes throughout your house, it might be time to think about whole-house repiping. Couple of homeowners are delighted with the concept of replacing all their pipes, however dealing with the task prior to the plumbing system fails allows you to avoid considerable residential or commercial property damage.</p>
