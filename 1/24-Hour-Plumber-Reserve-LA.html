<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are determined from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer minimizes water service pressure to the building; additional, more significant expenses can happen if the drop in water pressure becomes a concern for citizens. If setting up a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help figure out.</p>
<p>The Delaware Division of Public Health Plumbing License and Inspection Program has offices in Kent and Sussex Counties. For example, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can trigger pipes to lose pressure. When that happens, water is no longer pressed forward into the residential or commercial property, enabling it to flow backwards into city water supplies.</p>
