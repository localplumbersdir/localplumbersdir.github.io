These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the risk of damage to your house and family.</p>
