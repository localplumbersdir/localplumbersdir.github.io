<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl).
