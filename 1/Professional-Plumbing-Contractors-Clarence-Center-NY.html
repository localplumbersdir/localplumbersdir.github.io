<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is usually the offender. But not always. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing firmly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can cause difficulty too. Photo 3 demonstrates how to set the slack perfect.</p>
<p>Replacing the old disposal with an identical brand-new one is less complicated than replacing with a various design. So, if you are not looking particularly for a various disposal this may be something to think about. An entirely various disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink adapter needs to be puttied into place. A secure seal is a must. As soon as linked at the sink drain, the dishwasher connector is attached. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, taking care to link wires properly, and the base covered to secure the wiring from any water getting in.</p>
