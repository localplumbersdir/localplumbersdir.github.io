<p>Before the repair professional starts the repair process, he should make certain he has evaluated the workspace around the backflow prevention assembly in order to recognize any limiting conditions. Appropriate safety precautions should be followed for appropriate entry if the area is considered a restricted space. A correct and safe  work environment might involve the placement of safety barricades or entry limitations around the work area so the repair professional or the general public around your work area are not damaged. This might impact the specialist's ability to successfully finish the repair if the backflow preventer is set up in a limiting area.</p>
<p>At any time the pressure on the home (downstream) side exceeds the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. However, while DCV systems are considered safe for a lot of fire security systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves stop working or debris in the water line prevents them from closing completely, backflow can occur.</p>
