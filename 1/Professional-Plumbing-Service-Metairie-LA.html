<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the ideal length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, just link it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if necessary, to insert the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you may need to make a time-wasting trip to the store. To prevent this, ensure the brand-new garbage disposal installation package consists of a tube, or purchase one separately at the same time for about $3.</p>
<p>As soon as installed, these BPAs go through routine and preliminary testing and maintenance requirements to validate their continued operational effectiveness. Such testing should be performed by a state licensed Back-flow Prevention Assemble Tester signed up with the City of Austin. Licensing, registration and other tester-specific information is likewise readily available online (see Backflow Prevention Assembly Tester Details ).</p>
<p>Your water heater. The pro will next examine your water heater. With your hot water heater, she or he is taking a look at water temperature, pressure relief valves and pipes, and any rust in the tank (unless it's a tankless water heater ). Some will also flush your water heater at this time, which is an annual maintenance task that prevents tough water and sediment buildup. To do this, the plumber will drain the water out of the tank with a hose and run clean water through the tank to wash out any accumulation.</p>
