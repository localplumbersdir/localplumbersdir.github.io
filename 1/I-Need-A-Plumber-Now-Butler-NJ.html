<p>E.R. Services understands the importance of keeping the stability and effectiveness of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a favorable charge. Salt, the mineral that water softeners utilize to replace hardness ions, also has a positive charge, so none of these ions are drawn in to each other. Nevertheless, sodium's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't attracted to each other, how can an exchange occur? There is one other vital element needed to make the process work: a resin bed including lots of small, negatively-charged beads.</p>
<p>Rusting and corrosion on the exterior of the water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can indicate a prospective concern with the hot water heater.
