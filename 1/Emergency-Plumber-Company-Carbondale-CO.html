<p>Any place water goes through home. This includes sinks, toilets, tubs, lines, and pipes. At this time, the pro will try to find leakages and damaged pipes or fittings. With toilets, the pro will inspect water levels, flappers, and filler systems. He or she will eyeball noticeable pipes, and might run a camera inspection to inspect the pipes' condition from the inside.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you believe a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: squirt a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, check to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually altered color. If it has, you most likely have a leak.</p>
<p>The source or place of a sewer problem identifies who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another.

Easements (usually 10 feet wide) where main sewers pass through personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
