It may be typical to have condensation on warm water pipes, however it's absolutely not regular for your pipes to spring a leak.</p>
<p>Gently listen and lift the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. You may be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). Flex the float arm if there is no change screw. Make sure it's adjusted appropriately (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't have to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first shot using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. A number of these cleaners contain concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very damaging if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make certain to take the suitable precautions if utilizing one of these products.</p>
