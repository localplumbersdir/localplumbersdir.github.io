<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Grover Beach CA</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
