<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
