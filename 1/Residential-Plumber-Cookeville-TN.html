<p>Backflow preventers are a fairly basic system, in spite of their significance.

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
