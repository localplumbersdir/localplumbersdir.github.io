<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Medina NY</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
