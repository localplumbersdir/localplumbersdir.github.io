<p>Aside from these 2 important components, there are a myriad of little, maybe less important things that can degrade or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in great shape for it to operate at its best.</p>

He likewise finished the job faster than initial estimated, so the work was more economical than I anticipated. I will use Gotelli Plumbing once again in the future.</p>
