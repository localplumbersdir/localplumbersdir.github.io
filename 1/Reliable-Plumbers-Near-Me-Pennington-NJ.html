<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is really a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.
