Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they should be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
<p>Installing a new gas line for a pool heater expenses between $700 and $1,400, consisting of the connection and new gas line.
