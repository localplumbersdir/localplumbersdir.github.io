<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
