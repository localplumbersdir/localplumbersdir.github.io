<p>The pipe-bursting technique is utilized on pipes that are badly damaged, for replacing a whole pipe system, or for repairing bigger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, which includes 2 four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by positioning a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be invulnerable to root intrusion for approximately 100 years.</p>
<p>You reside in an older house. If your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never ever changed its pipes, there's a good chance that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were frequently installed in houses of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to burst and rust when they get old.

Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to describe an unwanted flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water brings pollutants back to the primary supply of water system, making the water in it risky to consume.</p>
