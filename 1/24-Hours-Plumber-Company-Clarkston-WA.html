<p>In this scenario, filthy water from the hillside swimming pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You also need to purchase a backflow valve if you notice your water has an unusual flow, smell, taste or color. A plumbing professional can figure out whether the problem with your faucet is a fast fix or the outcome of other concerns in your home's plumbing system. More complicated issues with water temperature level or pressure may require changing the water heater, which normally costs $350-$ 3,500, depending upon capacity and type.</p>
<p>Check Valves and Double Checks. There are 2 other kinds of backflow preventers offered that you may face. The very first is a check valve. The 2nd is a double check". It is NOT the same thing as a Check even though it may be marketed as one! Don't get swindled! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Double Checks have losses comparable to Double Checks (5 PSI).</p>
