<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
