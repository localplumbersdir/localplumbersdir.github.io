<p>To figure out if your home is a poly home," begin with the exterior. Underground water pipe are generally blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is usually 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Often, it gets in the home near the hot water heater. Your main shut off is connected to the end of the water pipe. Make sure you examine both ends of the pipe.
