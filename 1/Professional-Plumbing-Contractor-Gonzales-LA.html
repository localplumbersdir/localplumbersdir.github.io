<p>Some manufacturers claim that the electrical gadgets they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has shown a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in areas where the ambient temperature is kept at or above 40 ° F.

The addition of this chemical additive will need the installation of a high hazard defense assembly.</p>
