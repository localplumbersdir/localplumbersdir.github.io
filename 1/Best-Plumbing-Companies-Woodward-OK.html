Water pressure might fail or be decreased when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water system (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may permit polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
