<p>Strong sewage odor in your bathroom and other locations of your home. A sewage odor originating from your bathroom or another area of your house can be an indication of a severe problem with your plumbing. Pipes in your house might have burst or otherwise broken.

<p>Drain blockages in bathroom sinks can occur over time from the buildup of hair, little bits of soap and fibers from towels that collects within pipes. As a clog ends up being bigger gradually, it obstructs the pipe, stopping water from draining properly.
