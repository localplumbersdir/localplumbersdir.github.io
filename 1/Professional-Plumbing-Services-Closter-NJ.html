<p>Replacing your sink is a step-by-step process. Measure, cut, and connect the pipes. Prior to attaching any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the system to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are utilizing copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape.
