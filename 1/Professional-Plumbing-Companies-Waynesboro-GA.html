<p>If you have an older house, there's a good chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to wear away. This deterioration can cause an accumulation of lead, which can have many unfavorable results on your health. Rusty pipes likewise lead to poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Low pH also increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the step of hydrogen ion activity in a service and is used to reveal the intensity of the level of acidity of a service. Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are compounds that release hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, accelerating deterioration Co2 will potentially contribute to the formation of carbonic acid, thus making the water more destructive. The existence of high levels of carbon dioxide tends to associate with particular geologic conditions.</p>
