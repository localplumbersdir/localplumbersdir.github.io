<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of 2 classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a predetermined schedule and after that go back to service. Due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt.

Such models are practical if you have a fluctuating water utilize schedule.</p>
