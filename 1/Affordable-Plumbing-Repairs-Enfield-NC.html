<p>If you don't have a plumber's snake, you can use a wire coat wall mount by straightening it. Of course, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it might be long enough to reach some blockages. Insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or take out the clog if you can reach it. Be careful not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
