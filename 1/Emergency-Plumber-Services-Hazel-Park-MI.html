<p>When you remove the cap to eliminate the valve, examine the washer for wear or fractures. Changing a bad washer is cheap and easy. But finding the best washer may not be. The most common washers are typically offered at home centers and hardware shops. Other styles can be tough to discover. Remove it and take it to the shop to discover a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers typically replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
<p>In fact, that's how hard water" got its name, from the solidified mineral deposits this type of water leaves behind.

<p>Gently listen and raise the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. If the water shuts down, you may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no modification screw, bend the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's adjusted effectively (Image 8). You do not have to clear the tank to make these changes.</p>
