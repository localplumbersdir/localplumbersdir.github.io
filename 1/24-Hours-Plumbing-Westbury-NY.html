<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are devices that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium.

After going through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
