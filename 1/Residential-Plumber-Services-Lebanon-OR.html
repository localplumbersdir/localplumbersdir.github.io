Residences built in the first part of the 1900s were plumbed using lead pipes. At that time, people had no concept that the lead in the pipes might seep into the drinking water, let alone the health hazards connected with lead.</p>
<p>Installation and replacement costs are frequently similar, though replacement usually will not require additional charges, such as application fees. New meters should satisfy policies and code requirements for their placement, and gas service providers might need an unique meter for their services, restricting your options. Layout - Once you add a 2nd floor and even 3rd floor, pipes need to be run up to it. This is more complicated than plumbing the ground floor and is more labor extensive. Plumbing services will utilize more materials which adds to your labor costs.</p>
