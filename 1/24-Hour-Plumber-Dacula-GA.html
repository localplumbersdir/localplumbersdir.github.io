<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a practical solution, specifically when easy plunging does not seem to work. However, there are numerous downsides to using these hazardous items - not least of which is that they typically consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the risk of damage to your house and household.</p>
