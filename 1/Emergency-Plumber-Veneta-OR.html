<p>Very seldom does any structural damage take place as the outcome of slab leak. A slab leak is usually detected before it triggers any substantial damage. The water leak is usually the size of a pinhole. This small hole allows water to constantly leak out very gradually. Over time it can lead to a significant build of water. Leaked water normally stays under the house and saturates into the ground soil. If the home's structure was not properly compressed, this can potentially cause a cavity. This is an uncommon event and in basic, there is little concern over structural damage as the result of a slab leak.</p>
