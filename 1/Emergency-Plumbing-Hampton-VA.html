Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
