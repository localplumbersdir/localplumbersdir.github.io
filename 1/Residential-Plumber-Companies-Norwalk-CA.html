Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the drinkable water system within a building these devices are called seclusion" BFP. Once again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air gap, if there is no other way to provide one, then we inspect to see that the appropriate BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are designed to supply decades of security. There are numerous regional conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as excessive pressure, water temperature level, quality or turbidity can all cause the assembly to weaken in its performance. Some backflow prevention assemblies might rarely need repair while some are repaired regularly. The test data from the field test will determine the repair frequency.</p>
