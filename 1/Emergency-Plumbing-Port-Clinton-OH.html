<h3>Clear Clogged Toilet in Port Clinton Ohio</h2>
<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the sodium is switched for the difficult water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>Tank to Tank installation: On average, replacing a gas or electrical water tank with a comparable model takes two to three hours. It takes in between 45 to 60 minutes to drain, disconnect and remove your old water heater.
