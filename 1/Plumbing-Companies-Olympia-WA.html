Sodium sesquicarbonate is a hydrated crystal made up from sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate and is really commonly discovered in bath salts. Running a gas line does require either a structure authorization or a plumbing authorization. For more complex setups and projects, extra or unique licenses may be needed.
