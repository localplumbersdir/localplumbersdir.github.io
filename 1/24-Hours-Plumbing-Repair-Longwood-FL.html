A toilet's tank is made up of several little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or fixed due to their frequent usage. When these parts wear out, they lead to small leaks that are tough to see with the naked eye.

Anything you put down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
