<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Tired of False Assures? Water flows in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding.

When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regrowth). Throughout this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely focused saltwater service (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
