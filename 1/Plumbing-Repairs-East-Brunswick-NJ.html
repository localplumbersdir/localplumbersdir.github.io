<p>There are a variety of things that can fail with your sewer line. Like all pipes, the sewer line will not last permanently. It has actually remained in location given that your house was constructed so it has to do with the exact same age as your home. There are some things that can damage a sewer pipe such as freeze and thaw cycles and corrosion. Blunt force can break a pipe, such as when construction is being done at or near your house.</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY task. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Pieces that comprise kitchen sink drains can end up being corroded and used, resulting in leaks. Depending upon the intensity of the circumstance, just one piece may need replacement, or the whole under-sink assembly should be removed and replaced. Components involved include slip nut joints and washers, tubing leading from the sink, P-trap or S-trap assemblies and sink drain baskets. Incorrectly set up P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not protected by nut joints and washers, must be reconfigured.</p>
