<p>Letters are sent to residential customers with recognized backflow devices on a yearly basis. The City's plumbing code needs a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, swimming pools, and hot tubs. Rotate the disposal system to line up the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and after that link it. Relying on the existing trap setup, you may need to replace some or all of the drain piping beneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>If you observe low water pressure or tarnished water, it usually symbolizes rust and mineral buildup. As rust and minerals build up with time, they restrict the flow of the water which is why you might observe lower water pressure. The staining happens when rust becomes loose from the pipes and flow into your supply of water, impacting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can become a health danger in your water.</p>
