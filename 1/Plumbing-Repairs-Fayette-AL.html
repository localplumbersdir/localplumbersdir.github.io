<p>Your hot water heater is one of the most essential components of your home's plumbing system Hot water heater are responsible for producing all of the heated water you need for bathing, cleaning, cooking, and taking care of other daily tasks.

<p>Remodeling plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend much more. With this approach, you know the turnkey cost entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
