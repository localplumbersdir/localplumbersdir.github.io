<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An important thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the element. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each component. If the part is not fixed effectively, the guide might limit the movement (rather than direct or constant) of the element, which could trigger the element to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
