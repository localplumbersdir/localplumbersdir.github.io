Though it may require additional adapters, flexible tubing is far much easier to deal with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>

<p>If you have actually always resided in an area with tough water, you might not understand just how much it affects you-- but if you've just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too familiar with the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can result from tough water. Hard water hinders the lathering of hair shampoos and soaps, triggering you to use more. Hard water also makes it harder to clean soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp.
