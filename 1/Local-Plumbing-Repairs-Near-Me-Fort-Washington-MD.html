<p>A general rule is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan. If, state, you need a new burner kit and the hot water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more uncertain the economics of a repair ends up being. The reason is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>
