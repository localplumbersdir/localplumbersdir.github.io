<p>For plumbing work other that repair or replacement components, a structure license is typically needed before a plumbing permit can be issued. Soften just what you need to. Individuals often select to soften showers, sinks, and laundry connections. Toilets, hose bibs, basement sinks, and other cold water taps usually do not need to be connected to a softener. In a lot of cases, individuals select to soften only the hot water.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, carefully lift the rod and listen. You may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no modification screw, bend the float arm. Make sure it's changed correctly (Photo 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't need to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on an established schedule and after that return to service. These work well for families that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt due to the fact that they regrow whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, normally restore after numerous gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have an ever-changing water use schedule, such designs are hassle-free.</p>
