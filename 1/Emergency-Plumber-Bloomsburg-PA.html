<p>Backflow implies the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
