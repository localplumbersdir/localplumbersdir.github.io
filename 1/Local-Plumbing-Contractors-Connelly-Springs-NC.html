<p>A cross-connection is any momentary or permanent connection in between a public water system or consumer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping in between a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>Low pH also increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the step of hydrogen ion activity in a solution and is used to reveal the strength of the acidity of a solution. Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are substances that release hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, accelerating corrosion Carbon dioxide will potentially add to the formation of carbonic acid, consequently making the water more corrosive. The presence of high levels of co2 tends to associate with specific geologic conditions.</p>
