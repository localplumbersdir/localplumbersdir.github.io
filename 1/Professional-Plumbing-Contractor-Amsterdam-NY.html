The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (generally 10 feet large) where main sewers pass through personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>A number of companies, such as the American Water Works Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) use accreditation courses developed to train specialists to test backflow preventers. Requirements for training vary by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers needs understanding of installation requirements, although inspectors are not required to end up being certified.</p>
