<p>When used in fighting a fire, fire department connections can be an issue. Firefighters by and big are not concerned with backflow prevention problems. They are concerning with protecting people's lives and to a lower extent their residential or commercial property.

This can produce cross-connection control problems and may as an outcome mean that the level of security on the fire protection system may need to be increased to a high hazard protection level.</p>
<p>Remodeling plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest much more. With this approach, you know the turnkey rate going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
