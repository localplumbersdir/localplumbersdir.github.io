<p>Some homeowners may consider water softeners as a high-end product, something that's good to have" but not completely required. However, hard water can cause whatever from minor annoyances, like areas on meals or soap residue, to major problems like a shorter life expectancy for your hot water heater, dishwasher, and other necessary house devices. For these factors and others, a water softener can be a beneficial financial investment for your home.</p>
