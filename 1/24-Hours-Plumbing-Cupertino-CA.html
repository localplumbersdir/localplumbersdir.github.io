<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Cupertino CA</h3>
<p>These guys were remarkable! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for several years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company since they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable cost, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job tidying up after it too.</p>
