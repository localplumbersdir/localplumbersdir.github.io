<p>The best source for this type of plumber is a basic contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered; you do not get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor knows the telltale signs of quality work that you may miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, properly sized holes in floorings, joists, and studs. Finally, a quality contractor will not risk dealing with a shoddy plumber. A simple mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily ravage $10,000 worth of walls or wood floorings and make complex the job with insurance claims, lost time, and suits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to only the best.</p>
