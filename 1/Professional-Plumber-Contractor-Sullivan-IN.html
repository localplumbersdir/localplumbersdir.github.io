<p>The usual service is to have the faulty pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an option to think about if you live in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for lots of years, however steel ultimately struggles with corrosion and does not have the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

<p>2. Free the waste disposal unit from the mounting assembly. Any driver who ignores a leaky fuel line is obviously at major danger of becoming a fire casualty, Lavacot says, as gas is spurting from their vehicle somewhere. Like whatever else in your house, your plumbing pipes won't last permanently. Often a small leak can be fixed, but sometimes replacing your pipes is a better long-lasting service.
