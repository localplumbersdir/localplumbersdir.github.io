<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code safeguards the public water supply and private on-site water system and distribution systems by forbiding cross-connections in between safe and clean (appropriate for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by requiring installation of secondary and main backflow prevention approaches.

Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has shown a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>

The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement.
