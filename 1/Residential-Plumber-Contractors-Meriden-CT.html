<p>The secret to avoiding a clogged waste disposal unit is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at an affordable quantity, there must be no issue in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you should probably not take into the waste disposal unit though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop obstructing is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>
