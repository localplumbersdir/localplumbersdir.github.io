<p>Galvanized steel potable water supply and circulation pipes are frequently found with nominal pipe sizes from 3⁄8 inch (9.5 mm) to 2 inches (51 mm). It is hardly ever used today for new building and construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) basic tapered male threads, which get in touch with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (typically known just as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is fairly costly, and tough to deal with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It stays in common use for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building regulations non-combustibility requirements usually discovered in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications. It is also very resilient and resistant to mechanical abuse. Black lacquered steel pipe is the most extensively utilized pipe product for fire sprinklers and gas.</p>

A pump utilized to increase the water pressure within a structure's plumbing system to reach a higher floor may trigger this. Preventive cleaning for drains must be carried out on all drains, including toilet, tub, sink and floor drains.</p>
