<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Changing the old disposal with an identical brand-new one is less complicated than replacing with a various design.

Once linked at the sink drain, the dishwasher port is attached. The last thing is to wire up the new disposal, taking care to connect wires accurately, and the base covered to safeguard the wiring from any water getting in.</p>
