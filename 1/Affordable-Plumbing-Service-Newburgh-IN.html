<h3>Looking For A Plumber In Newburgh IN</h3>

I chose this company because they had fantastic reviews and a fair price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic job tidying up after it also.</p>
