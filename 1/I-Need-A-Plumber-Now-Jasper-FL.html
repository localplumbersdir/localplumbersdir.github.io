However, salt's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't brought in to each other, how can an exchange take place? There is one other vital component needed to make the process work: a resin bed consisting of great deals of small, negatively-charged beads.</p>
<p>High water pressure likewise damages plumbing. The water coming into the home puts excess pressure on faucet seal, water shut down valves and supply lines, and toilets. High water pressure causes leakages, running toilets and other plumbing problems that will continue to happen without proper pressure reduction.

The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
