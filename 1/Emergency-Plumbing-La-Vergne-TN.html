<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Fed Up With False Assures? Water distributes in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regeneration). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the highly focused saltwater option (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
