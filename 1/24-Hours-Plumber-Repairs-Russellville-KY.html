<p>Water temperature issues can be repaired by adjusting the temperature on the hot water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet might be triggered by a blocked aerator screen. House owners can simply loosen the aerator screen from the faucet to clean out minerals or other deposits. Water pressure can also be low if the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way.</p>
<p>Water supplied by the water company contains some amounts of damaging chemicals like arsenic and lead. Water filtration systems eliminate these impurities to make drinking water clean, clear and tastier. As such, water filtration systems are necessary requirements, not optional expenses.
