We can find a drain that will look good with your existing décor if you have a historic home.

As soon as connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher connector is attached. The last thing is to wire up the new disposal, taking care to link wires precisely, and the base covered to protect the electrical wiring from any water getting in.</p>
