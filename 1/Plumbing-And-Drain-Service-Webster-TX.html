<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a fixed schedule and after that return to service. These work well for families that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt because they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, generally restore after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such designs are hassle-free if you have a changing water use schedule.</p>
