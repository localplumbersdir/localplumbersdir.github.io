<p>Gas leakages are commonly found at the gas valve, flare fitting, or at the gas union-a piece that permits connections and disconnections of gas home appliances. If you use liquid meal soap to the believed area, a fast way to find a gas leak is. If it bubbles, you likely have a gas leak and ought to immediately contact a gas plumber to perform an emergency gas line repair.</p>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
