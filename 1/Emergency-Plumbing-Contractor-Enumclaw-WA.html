<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were built prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This rust, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a water resistant membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>

<p>Hellenbrand water softeners and conditioners eliminate calcium and magnesium from your water, leaving it softer and cleaner. Simply put, soft water saves you money. Minimized Pressure Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP): An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of 2 individually acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve between the check valves and listed below the very first check valve.</p>
<p>At any time the pressure on the home (downstream) side exceeds the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. However, while DCV systems are thought about safe for a lot of fire security systems, they do have a defect: if both valves stop working or particles in the water line avoids them from closing entirely, backflow can take place.</p>
