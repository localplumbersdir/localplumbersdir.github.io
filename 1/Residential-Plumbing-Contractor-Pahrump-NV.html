<p>The U-shaped pipe below kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people expect to see but seldom stop to think of. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the proper size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
