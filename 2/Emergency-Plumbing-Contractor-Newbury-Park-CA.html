<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and costly plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire home repiping. Current Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 years of age Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. It was a tough task because of the age of your home and place of the pipe. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
