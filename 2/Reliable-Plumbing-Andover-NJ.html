When drains are working correctly that's truly all you need to understand about them, however when something goes wrong, you need to have a much deeper understanding of what type of problems can happen in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage. That's where a professional plumber comes in-- they have the knowledge to diagnose a problem and the tools and understanding to fix it.</p>
