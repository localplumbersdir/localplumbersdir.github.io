<h3>Water Tank Repair in Danbury Connecticut</h2>
<p>The traditional water heater has a tank that is filled with continuously heated water. It wastes energy by holding the temperature of water that is not currently in use.

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are set up in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
