<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend much more. With this technique, you know the turnkey price entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>

Many property owners ultimately notice hair or soap residue building up in their sinks. When not immediately remedied, the stopper or drain may become blocked. As any house owner will understand, clogged drains aren't the only problems that can plague bathroom sinks and faucets.</p>
