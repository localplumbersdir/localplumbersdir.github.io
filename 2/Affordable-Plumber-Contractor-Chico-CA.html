<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
