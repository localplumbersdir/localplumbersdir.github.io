Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and reduces the basic structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and may fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Improper installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to spot.</p>
