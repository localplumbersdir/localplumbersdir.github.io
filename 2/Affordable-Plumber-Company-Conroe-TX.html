<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
