<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
