<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is reducing, the heavy brine solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
