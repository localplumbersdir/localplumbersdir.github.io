<p>The pipe-bursting method is used on pipes that are severely damaged, for changing a whole pipe system, or for repairing bigger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, that includes 2 four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by putting a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe.
