Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
