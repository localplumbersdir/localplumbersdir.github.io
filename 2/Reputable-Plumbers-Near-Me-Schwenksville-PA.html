It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the drawback shut off remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air needs to be removed from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from important areas in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will build up.</p>
<p>When it comes to repairing a broken or failing sewer line, there are a couple of choices.
