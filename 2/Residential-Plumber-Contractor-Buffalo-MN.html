When these parts wear, they lead to tiny leaks that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is important to call a plumber as soon as you think you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet waste water, it can likewise lead to flooding and water damage.</p>

When setting up a brand-new toilet, the plumber may likewise need to make adjustments to your bathroom's plumbing, which will raise the total cost of the job.</p>
