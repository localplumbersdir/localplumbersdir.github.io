<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super happy with their service.</p>
