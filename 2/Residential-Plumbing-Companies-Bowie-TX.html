People with extremely soft water can use smaller sized amounts of soap and cleaning agent for washing.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Examine spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction throughout the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
