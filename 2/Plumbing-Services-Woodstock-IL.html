When chemicals are included to a fire protection system provided by a drinkable water supply, increased security is also needed.

Hanging on a pipeline might cause it to come loose or break, releasing gas into the house. The outdoor gas meter must be kept clear of any particles, such as plants or snow, so it is quickly accessible in an emergency.</p>
