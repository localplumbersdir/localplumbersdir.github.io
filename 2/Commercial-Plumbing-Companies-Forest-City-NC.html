Leaks can also occur if you run into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from taking place, install the unit in a stable and safe location. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener doesn't fall over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regeneration, you ought to wait till after the cycle is completed and then checked the system for fractures or broken fittings.
