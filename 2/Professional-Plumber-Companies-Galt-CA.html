<p>After you've installed the unit, put a. stopper in the drain and fill the sink up with an inch of water. Examine below for any indications of leaks.

Gas Devices Malfunctioning: Another common indicator that your gas line might be damaged is if you discover the malfunctioning of home appliances in your home that are powered by gas. For example, if your gas stove and hot water heater stop working at the exact same time, you most likely have a gas line problem.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. Once the resin beads become full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
