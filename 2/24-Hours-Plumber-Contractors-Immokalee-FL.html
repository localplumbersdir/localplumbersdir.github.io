<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the right length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if required, to insert the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you might have to make a time-wasting journey to the store. To avoid this, make certain the new garbage disposal installation package includes a tube, or purchase one individually at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
<p>5. Pour hot water down your drain after using the garbage disposal - In order to get rid of extraneous grease that can clog your kitchen sink, wash your drain with a little bit of warm water.

Fortunately, you do not always need the assistance of a professional to fix it.</p>
