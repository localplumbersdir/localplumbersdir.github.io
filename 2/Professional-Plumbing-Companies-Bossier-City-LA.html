At Hall's Plumbing, we work with Woodland, CA homeowners whenever they need repiping service or pipe repair.</p>
<p>There are numerous causes for blockages depending upon where they occur in your plumbing Toilets clog from too much bathroom tissue for the most part. When the toilet tissue collects in the sewer pipe leading from the toilet instead of flowing through it, the toilet will not flush. The water only back up in the bowl. There are times when our plumber needs to eliminate the toilet to unclog the drain properly.</p>
<p>There's a great possibility you have galvanized pipes if you have an older house. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to corrode. This deterioration can result in an accumulation of lead, which can have many unfavorable impacts on your health. Rusty pipes likewise result in poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
