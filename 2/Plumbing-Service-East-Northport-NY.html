<p>No other room in a home includes as many pipes and plumbing fixtures as the bathroom. Prevention is better than cure. If you have a well or a watering system, you need to install a backflow device on your water system. Discolored water- Your water ought to always be crystal clear. Discolored water is a sign of rust in your pipes or hot water heater. If your water is an uncommon color, this warrants professional attention.
