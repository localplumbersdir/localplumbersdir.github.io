<p>The usual service is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an option to think about if you reside in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many decades, however steel ultimately struggles with deterioration and lacks the sturdiness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
