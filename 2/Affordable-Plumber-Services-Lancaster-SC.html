<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>The Delaware Department of Public Health Plumbing Permit and Inspection Program has workplaces in Kent and Sussex Counties. For instance, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can cause water pipes to lose pressure. When that occurs, water is no longer pressed forward into the residential or commercial property, allowing it to flow backward into city water supplies.</p>
