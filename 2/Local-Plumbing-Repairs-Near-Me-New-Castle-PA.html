Before setting up, your professional will switch off water and electricity to the area. Next, the old sink flange is eliminated and cleaned of any putty residue. Then, a brand-new mounting ring is installed to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is connected, and the disposal is linked to its mount. In this approach, water is treated with a calculated quantity of washing soda (Na2CO3) which converts the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get precipitated.</p>
