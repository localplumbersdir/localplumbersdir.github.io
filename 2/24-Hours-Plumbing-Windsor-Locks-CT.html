Like any house appliance, a toilet tank includes many little moving parts that might need replaced with usage over time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all break and cause toilet leakages that aren't clearly visible to the naked eye. Toilet leaks around the base can also take place around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
