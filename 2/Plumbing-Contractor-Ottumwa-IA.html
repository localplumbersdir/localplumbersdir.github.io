<h3>What To Do First When I Need An Emergency Plumber Near Me Ottumwa IA</h3>
<p>These men were fantastic! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company since they had great reviews and a reasonable price, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific task tidying up after it as well.</p>
