<p>The normal option is to have the defective pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an option to think about if you live in an older house - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for many decades, however steel eventually experiences corrosion and does not have the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
