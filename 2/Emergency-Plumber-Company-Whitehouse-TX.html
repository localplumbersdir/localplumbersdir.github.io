<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. The professional shut off the water system and loosened the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor.

Copper is also typically used because of its durability and more secure construction, but polyethylene piping lasts longer than anything on the market and guarantees the healthiest and cleanest water flow.</p>
