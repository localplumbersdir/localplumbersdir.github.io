<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is an individual preference. Water softener systems work by eliminating solidity minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to inhibit the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the solidity itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener alternative in areas where it is prohibited to use salt. Water conditioners do not effectively eliminate solidity from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
