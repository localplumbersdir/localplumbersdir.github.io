I selected this company since they had excellent reviews and a reasonable price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific task tidying up after it as well.</p>
