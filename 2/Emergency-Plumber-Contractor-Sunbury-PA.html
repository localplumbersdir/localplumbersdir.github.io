<p>Examine the house's hot water heater You will be seeking to see if it is big enough to accommodate your needs (a household of four ought to have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the hot water heater's age. Check to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can choose the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will suggest that less water will be heated up and available for use. Likewise, corrosion of the tank's components can cause the tank to have a brief life. Demand that a new one be set up if the water heater is old or you see apparent signs of rust.</p>
