<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your home, which makes its plumbing's efficient working a necessity more than a need. Once the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process. It is essential that the plumbing system be switched on extremely gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to guarantee no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close effectively when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>

I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters.
