<p>There are a variety of things that can go wrong with your sewer line. Like all pipes, the sewer line won't last permanently. It has actually remained in location because your home was constructed so it is about the same age as your house. There are some things that can harm a sewer pipe such as freeze and thaw cycles and corrosion. Blunt force can break a pipe, such as when construction is being done at or near your home.</p>
<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable television or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
