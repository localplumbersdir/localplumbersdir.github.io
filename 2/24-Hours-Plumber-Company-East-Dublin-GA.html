<p>I have actually been impressed with your company and its people from the day your sales individual strolled in here, through all service personel, and now. By the method, this is a great system. Our energy expenses are much lower then in the past, the air flow is virtually undetectable, the air temperature inside is even, the humidity contstant, and we have had no failures given that installation.</p>
<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer lowers water service pressure to the building; additional, more substantial expenses can occur if the drop in water pressure becomes a concern for citizens. A PE or RA can assist determine if setting up a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss.</p>

You, therefore, need to use increasingly more detergent to achieve the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution.

Lastly, water consisting of the tough minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
