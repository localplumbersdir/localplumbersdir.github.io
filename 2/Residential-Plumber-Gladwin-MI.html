<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with homeowners in the area. He kept in mind that there are certain pollutants that homeowners are dealing with and an RO can help relieve those issues. Due to being mostly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some house owners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of agricultural waste.

<p>Improvement plumbers usually charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest far more.
