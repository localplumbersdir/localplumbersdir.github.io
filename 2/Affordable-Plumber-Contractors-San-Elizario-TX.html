<p>Replacing your sink is a step-by-step process. Step, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit.

Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it might require additional adapters, versatile tubing is far simpler to work with and can make use of push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
