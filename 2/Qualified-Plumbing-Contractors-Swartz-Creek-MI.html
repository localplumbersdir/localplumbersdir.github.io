Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and reduces the standard structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and might stop working without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to find.</p>
