All replacements must be installed to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the right type of assembly based upon the conditions on your home (see area listed below "Required Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Additionally, the assembly needs to fulfill the lead free requirement of Section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the one month, all water services will be stopped up until the assembly remains in compliance.</p>
<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the most part, a garbage disposal is only geared up to handle softer natural waste. If bones or other difficult foods get stuck in the disposal, it could cause it to jam and not work properly. By running hot water through the disposal, you may have the ability to clear the clog yourself. However you risk of damaging the motor or blades.</p>
<p>Typically caused by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then check and see if you see coloring in the bowl. This shows a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is typically the fix. Additionally, in some cases a defective fill valve may activate periodically, as well. Water won't drain or is draining gradually through the disposal.</p>
