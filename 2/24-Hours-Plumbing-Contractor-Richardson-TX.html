<p>Aside from these 2 important parts, there are a myriad of small, maybe less crucial things that can break or degrade. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more quickly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in good shape for it to work at its best.</p>
