<p>Check the home's hot water heater You will be wanting to see if it is huge enough to accommodate your needs (a household of four need to have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the hot water heater's age. Check to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will suggest that less water will be warmed and available for use. Also, corrosion of the tank's elements can cause the tank to have a brief life. Request that a new one be set up if the water heater is old or you see apparent indications of corrosion.</p>
