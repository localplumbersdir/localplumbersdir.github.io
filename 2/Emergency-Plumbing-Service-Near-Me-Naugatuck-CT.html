<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, gently raise the rod and listen. If the water shuts down, you may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no adjustment screw, bend the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make certain it's adjusted correctly (Photo 8). You don't have to clear the tank to make these adjustments.</p>

Another danger in sewer repair jobs is the collapse of earth from the walls around the dig site. Your safety and health are too essential to run the risk of in a Do It Yourself sewer project! Prevent these safety dangers by hiring a professional plumber.</p>
