<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>Aside from these 2 important components, there are a myriad of little, maybe less crucial things that can break or degrade. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more rapidly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst.
