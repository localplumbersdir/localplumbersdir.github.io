<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a predetermined schedule and after that go back to service. These work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt because they restore whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, typically regenerate after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such designs are practical if you have a changing water utilize schedule.</p>
