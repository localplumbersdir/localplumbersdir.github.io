<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
