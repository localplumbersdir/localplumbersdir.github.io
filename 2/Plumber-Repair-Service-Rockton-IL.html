<p>Template-Assisted Crystallization: Shortened to TAC, this technique utilizes resin beads as a catalytic nucleation website where hardness mineral ions are become a steady crystalline kind that will not cling to surface areas. These crystals are microscopic and circulation typically through the water. Unlike with a softener that utilizes ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not need ongoing regeneration.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank comes in. An on-board computer computes the amount of water that flows through the softener. Regrowth immediately starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and family of 4, regrowth typically occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
