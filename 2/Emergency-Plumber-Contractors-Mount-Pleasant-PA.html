Water pressure might be or fail minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high need on the water system (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened).

By setting up a garbage disposal you are helping the environment by saving the quantity of garbage that gets sent out to landfills and other dumping locations. With a waste disposal unit the trash is managed through already existing water facilities.</p>
