<p>Some producers declare that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself.

Testing of particular systems has shown a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
