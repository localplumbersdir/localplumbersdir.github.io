<p>When the safe and clean supply piping is linked to a system or fixture which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure might occur. Higher pressure can be triggered by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not correctly safeguarded, non-potable and potable water or liquids can be forced into the safe and clean supply system.</p>
