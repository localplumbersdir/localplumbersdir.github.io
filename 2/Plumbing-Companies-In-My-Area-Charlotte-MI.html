<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is generally the perpetrator. But not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing firmly. A chain with too little slack can cause difficulty too. Image 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends on the degree of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
