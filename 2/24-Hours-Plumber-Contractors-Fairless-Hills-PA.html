<p>Pieces that consist of kitchen sink drains can end up being corroded and used, resulting in leaks. Depending on the intensity of the situation, only one piece may need replacement, or the whole under-sink assembly should be gotten rid of and changed.

Incorrectly installed P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not protected by nut joints and washers, must be reconfigured.</p>
