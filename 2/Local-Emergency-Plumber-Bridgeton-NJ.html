<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from your home to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, rust or collapsed pipes. House owners might have a video inspection done to find the reason for regular sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or buying an older house.</p>
<p>Backflow preventers are a reasonably simple system, in spite of their significance. Most of commercial usage backflow prevention setups use a valve system that connects with the watering line within your business, where watering meets the main water supply.

This guarantees that water within sprinkler systems, water pumps, and other irrigation and wastewater systems stays disconnected from clean" water.</p>
