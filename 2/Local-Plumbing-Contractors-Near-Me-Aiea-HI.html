This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure.

<p>Hydro jetting is among many trenchless services available to you, accessible by means of North Georgia Inliner. Hydro jetting is the use of hot, highly pressurized water through a secured hose and nozzle to clear any and all clogs. This procedure is somewhat more environmentally friendly than snaking given that it just utilizes water, which your pipes are utilized to handling. Since a 2nd inspection isn't essential, it also saves you money and time.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above techniques do not work, the next step would be to eliminate the P-trap under the sink. Place a container underneath the area to catch water then unscrew the 2 threaded caps that hold the curved section of the pipe in location. Nowadays, a lot of kitchen drains are made from white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
