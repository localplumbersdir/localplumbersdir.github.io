<p>There's no part of your home that has more of a direct effect on your safety, benefit, convenience, and dependability than your plumbing system.

<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is necessary that the repair specialist knows the right installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly.

A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly just be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
