<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were developed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This deterioration, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a waterproof membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
