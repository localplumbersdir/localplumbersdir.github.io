In the ion exchange procedure, sodium ions are used to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or synthetic resin beads that look like damp sand.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another technique is to introduce a chemical substance that serves as a chelating representative.

<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the extent of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>

In some cases, the design or number will be on the underside of the lid or inside the tank. Matching an uncommon flapper can end up being an experimental process. Even professional plumbers sometimes attempt two or 3 flappers before they discover one that works well.</p>
