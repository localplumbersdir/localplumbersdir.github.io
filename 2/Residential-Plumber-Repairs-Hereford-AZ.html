These treatments do work, especially if you are dealing with a small drain clog. However, they are typically momentary fixes that do not use irreversible resolutions.</p>

Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no modification screw, flex the float arm. Make sure it's changed properly (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't have to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>
