If it happens, this unique aroma allows you to smell a prospective leak. Always leave if you believe a leak.</p>
<p>Water softeners typically have a life expectancy of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last a lot longer if they are appropriately maintained. Ensuring the brine tank never ever runs out of salt will extend the system's life.  Safeguarding the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will likewise secure the unit. Iron will nasty the resin and lower its ion exchange efficiency. Resin cleaners improve the regeneration cycle and help relieve the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
