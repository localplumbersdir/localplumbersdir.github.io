<p>A rule of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy. If, say, you need a brand-new burner set and the water heater is five years old, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more skeptical the economics of a repair ends up being. The reason is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>

<h3>24 Hour Plumbers & Services In Needham Heights MA</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves must avoid backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually run valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
