Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
