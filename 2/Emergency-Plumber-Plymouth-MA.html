I am truly grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>

<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, however likewise has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is because if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.

This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
