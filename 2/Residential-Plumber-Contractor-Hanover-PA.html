No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola consists of a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Clean with a soft fabric and after that more Coke, over and over, etc. If that does not work then use Naval Jelly which includes a lot more phosphoric acid (make certain to read the instructions and security warnings initially!). Naval Jelly is what we here at Â® use to get rid of rust spots and it's readily offered at most hardware shops.</p>
