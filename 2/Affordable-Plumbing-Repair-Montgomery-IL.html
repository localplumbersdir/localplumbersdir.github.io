<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>

<p>Kitchen sinks are always susceptible to clogs with food and grease being the major perpetrators. If fats are put down the sink, they congeal to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls too. Even tree roots can develop major drain blockages by twisting around pipes. Their crushing strength stops the water flow, forcing plumbers to find and repair the issue for regular house plumbing operations. You need your drain cleaned before it leads to more damage and even costlier repairs if this is what is happening to your house.</p>
