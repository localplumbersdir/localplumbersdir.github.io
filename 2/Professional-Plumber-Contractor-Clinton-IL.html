<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from your home to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, rust or collapsed pipes. Property owners may have a video inspection done to discover the reason for regular sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or buying an older home.</p>
<p>As part of EBMUD's program, the District's backflow inspectors are required to conduct website inspections to figure out if a backflow prevention device is required as a result of a actual or potential  cross-connection threat on a consumer's plumbing system. Plumbing and gas piping inspections located on Vashon Island are just carried out on Wednesdays. Spot Repairs: Using one or a mix of the above services, we will fix the problems we discover with the camera inspection straight without rooting out anymore than we have to.</p>
