<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to remove liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required.

The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
