Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is really low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an incredibly pure type of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
