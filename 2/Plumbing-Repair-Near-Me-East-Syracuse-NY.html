<p>It can clog pipes and soap will dissolve in it less easily when water is hard. Water softening can prevent these negative impacts. Gas is a colorless, odorless fuel. As a security precaution, we include a chemical odorant called mercaptan that gives natural gas an odor typically associated with rotten eggs. If it occurs, this distinctive fragrance allows you to smell a possible leak. Always leave if you suspect a leak.</p>
<p>Plumbing is a vital part of your home or service, and its ability to function is necessary. If you experience frequent problems with your plumbing, like drains obstructing, this could be an indication of a larger problem, like a tree root intrusion or a big clog. If the drains clog occasionally but you can generally flush them out, this may be a smaller sized clog like an accumulation of grease from the kitchen, or hair and soap residue from the bathroom. Small clogs can develop into huge ones fairly rapidly.</p>
