<p>Whether a supply of water is identified "soft" or "difficult" depends on the existence of two extremely soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health standpoint, these minerals have no negative impacts and are, in truth, vital daily nutrients. It is minerals that provide water the revitalizing taste many individuals find preferable.

At this moment the water is stated to be hard.</p>
