The installers begin by putting a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a brand-new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be impervious to root invasion for as much as 100 years.</p>
