<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Miami Beach FL</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>Was your house built before the 1970s and has not undergone remodeling or pipe replacement? It is most likely that your pipes are made of galvanized metal or another product which has rusted and decomposed over the years if so. Older pipes can cause major leaks and even pollute your water as they decay. Even the highest quality pipes will not last forever and will need to be changed.</p>
