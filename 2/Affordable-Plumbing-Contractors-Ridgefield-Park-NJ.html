<p>Aside from these two essential components, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less critical things that can weaken or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode a lot more rapidly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
<p>Our Fredericksburg toilet repair specialists can examine your issue and determine the ideal service to solve it. Whether we can carry out a repair or needs to recommend a replacement. Garbage disposals can weigh 15 lbs. or more. That's a lot of weight to all of a sudden catch with one hand while you're turning the lower mounting bracket with the other hand.</p>
