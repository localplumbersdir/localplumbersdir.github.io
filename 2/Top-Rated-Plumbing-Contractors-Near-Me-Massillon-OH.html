<p>Agilent's range of leak detection solutions guarantee the safety, security and constant performance of research, vacuum, and industrial procedure systems. Inspecting the water meter is an excellent next step in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and examine. If it is, there is a leak somewhere and this could be major issue. Proceed to the valves. Start with the main shut down valve operation. When shut off, no faucet in your house should have water. This goes for every other turned off valve and their matching faucets. If everything is working effectively, you are off to an excellent start.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this certification. I have actually contacted a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the rate to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
