Our energy expenses are much lower then before, the air flow is almost unnoticeable, the air temp within is even, the humidity contstant, and we have had no failures given that installation.</p>
<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>A garbage disposal lasts an average of 10 to 12 years. This typical lifespan calculation presumes normal wear and tear of the unit. The lifespan of a garbage disposal might be lower in the case of neglect, overuse, and abuse of the disposal system. Time for a brand-new bathroom or kitchen sink installation?
