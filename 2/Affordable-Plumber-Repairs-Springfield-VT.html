<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Fed Up With False Guarantees? Water circulates in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding.

Throughout this process, the resin beads are washed with the highly focused saltwater service (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
