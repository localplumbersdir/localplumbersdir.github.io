<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing process includes a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made from a non-conductive product.

Natural gas hot water heater are more energy effective and operating expense are reduced by about half, compared to electric water heaters. Storage tank hot water heater have a greater preliminary cost than electric.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to obtain this accreditation.
