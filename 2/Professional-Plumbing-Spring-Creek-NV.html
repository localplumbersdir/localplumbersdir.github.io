Nevertheless, there are numerous downsides to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they typically contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life.
