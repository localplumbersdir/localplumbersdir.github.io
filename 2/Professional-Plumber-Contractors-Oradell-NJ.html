Either through what's known as a batch feed, where the unit is filled, then covered before it is switched on, or through a continuous feed, where the unit can be filled while it is running.</p>
<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is typically made of aluminum or magnesium and remains as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can attract the irons that would normally trigger rust. After extended use, these rods will ultimately end up being worn and need to be changed.
