<p>5. Put warm water down your drain after utilizing the garbage disposal - In order to get rid of extraneous grease that can clog your kitchen sink, wash your drain with a little bit of warm water. Whether tree roots have made their way into your pipes or you flushed something you should not have, a clogged toilet is never an enjoyable experience. Luckily, you do not constantly need the assistance of a professional to fix it.</p>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not actually the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
