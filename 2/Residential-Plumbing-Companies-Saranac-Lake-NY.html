Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it might need additional adapters, versatile tubing is far easier to work with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
<p>Rusting and corrosion on the outside of the hot water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can show a possible issue with the water heater.
