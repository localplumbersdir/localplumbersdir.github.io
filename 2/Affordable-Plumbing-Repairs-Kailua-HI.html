The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) suggests changing to one of the other two types of salts if this stain is an annoyance in your home. As soon as the new salt has actually had an opportunity to totally replace the solar salt in your system, then purchase some water softener filter cleaner to clean out your softener as instructed in your owner's manual or on the cleaner label.</p>
