<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves ought to avoid backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually operated valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
