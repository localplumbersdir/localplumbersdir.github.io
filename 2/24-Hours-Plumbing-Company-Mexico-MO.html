It is very important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger a properly operating RPZ assembly to regularly release small amounts of water.

Appropriate drainage should also be offered.</p>
