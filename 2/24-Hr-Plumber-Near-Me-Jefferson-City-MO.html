<p>Improvement plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest a lot more. With this technique, you know the turnkey cost going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
<p>Community - Hard water can trigger an absence of suds development when soap is agitated in water and trigger the development of lime scale in water heaters. Your water is brown or red. Some types of pipes can rust in time. This rust will break off into your home's water supply and can turn your tap water a reddish or brown  color. In this case, repiping your home is required due to the fact that not only are your pipes old, but your water quality is affected as well.</p>
