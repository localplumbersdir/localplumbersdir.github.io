<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
