<h3>Discover The World Of Faucets For Improved Water Conservation Havre De Grace MD</h3>
<p>The most reliable method to address difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Strainers are suggested prior to each backflow prevention assembly on non-fire combating water lines.
