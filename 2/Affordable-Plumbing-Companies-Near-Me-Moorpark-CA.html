<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components may have really tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to recognize on each part is the guide.

Many times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
