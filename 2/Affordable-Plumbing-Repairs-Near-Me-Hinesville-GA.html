Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
