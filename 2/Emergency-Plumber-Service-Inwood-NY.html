<p>Toilet repair is one of the most common plumbing repairs done in houses today. This is probably due to the fact that there are anywhere from 300 to 350 million toilets in the U.S. alone. Due to the large variety of toilets, we have actually repaired many toilets in homes throughout the Tampa area so we are really accustomed to the products used and how they are installed here in your area. We also have actually done lots of toilet replacements also; this is typically required when either a resident chooses to replace their toilet with perhaps a more efficient one or when a toilet is merely beyond repair.</p>
<p>Was your house constructed before the 1970s and has not gone through improvement or pipe replacement? It is most likely that your pipes are made of galvanized metal or another product which has corroded and decayed over the years if so.
