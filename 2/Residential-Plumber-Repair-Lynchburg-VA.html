<p>Clogged toilets are one of the most common plumbing problems plumbers face, and for many people, it's an emergency when the toilet is ready to overflow.

The only purpose of salt in a water softener is to regenerate the resin beads that take the hardness out of water.</p>
<p>If you see low water pressure or discolored water, it usually symbolizes rust and mineral buildup. As rust and minerals build up over time, they restrict the flow of the water which is why you may notice lower water pressure. The staining happens when rust ends up being loose from the pipes and flow into your water system, impacting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or rust can become a health risk in your water.</p>
<p>That is an indication the tank is failing and will need to be changed if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank. If it is in a garage and a little slow leak, schedule a price quote as quickly as possible and guarantee nothing is near the heater that might be possibly harmed. Leaking water heaters can burst triggering water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
