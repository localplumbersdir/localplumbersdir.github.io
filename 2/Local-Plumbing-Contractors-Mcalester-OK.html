<p>Toilet flush handles are another part of a toilet that can trigger toilets to keep running. Often handles are toilet parts that get loose or rusty and no longer pull the flap up or drop it back down correctly. It's a simple repair, however there's a trick to getting the flush handle out. The keeping nut inside the tank is a reverse thread. So, if you're in front of the toilet, turn the nut to the delegated loosen up (Picture 1). Then get rid of the old handle and lever, slide the new handle into place, and thread on the maintaining nut. Tighten up by relying on the right (Image 2).</p>
<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
