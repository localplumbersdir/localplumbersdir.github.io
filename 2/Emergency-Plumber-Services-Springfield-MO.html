<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
