<h3>Hour Emergency Plumbing Service North Providence RI</h3>
<p>If pressure is lost, a backflow preventer stops water inside your water pipes from streaming back to the City system. Backflow can pollute the water supply. The standard system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow prevention device, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. All leaks, worn out fittings, and other plumbing problems will be fixed.</p>
<p>Any time the pressure on the residential or commercial property (downstream) side surpasses the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. Nevertheless, while DCV systems are considered safe for the majority of fire protection systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves fail or debris in the water line prevents them from closing totally, backflow can take place.</p>
