The unit selected for a provided installation should be suitable for the system style and website conditions, consisting of consideration of whether back siphoning or backpressure is most likely to occur. Further, it must be set up in accordance with plumbing codes, manufacturer specs, and engineering standards for the kind of system to be used.</p>
