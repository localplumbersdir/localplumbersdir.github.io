<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Leaks are tricky. You have probably seen drain cleaner items on the shelves at your local house enhancement store, so when your drain gets clogged or isn't draining water like it should, you may be lured to head down there and choose some approximately fix it by yourself.

<p>Backpressure is developed when pressure in a water supply exceeds the pressure in the potable system supplying the makeup water. This can require the drinkable water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection between the 2 systems. Prospective pollutants can then enter the drinkable water system.

In some areas of Virginia, where the water is especially hard with high mineral content, you may need to flush the hot water heater more often.</p>
