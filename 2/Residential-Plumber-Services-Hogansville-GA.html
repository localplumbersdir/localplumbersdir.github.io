<p>Examine the home's warm water heater You will be seeking to see if it is huge enough to accommodate your requirements (a household of 4 ought to have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the water heater's age. Check to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can settle on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will mean that less water will be heated and offered for usage.
