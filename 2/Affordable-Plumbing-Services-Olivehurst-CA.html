<h3>Cheap And Reliable Plumbers Olivehurst CA</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves need to prevent backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand run valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
<p>Because of the intrinsic style of a lowered pressure backflow assembly, varying supply pressure on a very low circulation or fixed circulation condition might cause annoyance leaking and possible fouling of the assembly. While not effective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve instantly ahead of the RPZ will often hold the pressure constant to the assembly in times of changing supply pressure.</p>
