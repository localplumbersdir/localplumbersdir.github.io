<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a fantastic person. He told me exactly what to expect (cost, time, process) up front and delivered as promised. I will certainly utilize Clog Dawg once again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These rates are in addition to the cost of the disposal system.

<p>Quality sinks appropriately installed last for decades, so we're generally employed for kitchen and bath remodels. However with spots or scratches in a kitchen sink along with chipped or broken porcelain in bathroom sinks many property owners choose a sink installation alone. Sinks and fixtures might also establish drain problems that call for a sink repair. Bathroom sink repairs also consist of adjusting or changing the pop-up stopper assembly.</p>
<p>Your waste disposal unit guarantees that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not include blades. Instead, a garbage disposal includes two fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind versus a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without obstructing.</p>
