<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing below the slab.

Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason we will suggest a complete repipe in specific communities, based on our experience.</p>
