Water softeners usually utilize salt (Na+) as the exchange ion. Salt ions are provided from dissolved sodium chloride salt, likewise called salt water. In the ion exchange process, salt ions are used to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or synthetic resin beads that resemble damp sand.</p>
