<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the difficult water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household appliances. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to explain an unwanted flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water carries pollutants back to the primary supply of water system, making the water in it hazardous to drink.</p>
