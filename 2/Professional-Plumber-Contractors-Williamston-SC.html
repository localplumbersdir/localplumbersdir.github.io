<p>Purchasing a house is a huge financial investment.

<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Instead, a garbage disposal includes two stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind against a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>
