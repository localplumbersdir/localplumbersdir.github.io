<p>Most softeners have actually a bypass built into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you need to supply some type of maintenance to it or perhaps while you're dealing with installing it. If the softener you choose does not have a bypass, then it's a good idea to construct one out of plumbing to bypass the devices in case you need to maintain the system.</p>
