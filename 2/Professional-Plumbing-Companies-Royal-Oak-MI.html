<p>Permanent magnetic water conditioning gadgets have been marketed based upon a variety of claims concerning their effect on water hardness and associated scale formation. The Water Quality Association, a not-for-profit trade association for the water treatment market, has not had the ability to determine standards for these items and report inconsistent performance to date. Research study has actually revealed no change occurs in the physical and chemical residential or commercial properties or the calcium ion concentration of water treated with the gadgets (The Water Quality Association Magnetics Task Force, 2001).</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
