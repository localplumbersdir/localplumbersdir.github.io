<h3>Drains Blocked Find A Good Emergency Plumber Now Montgomery AL</h3>
<p>These men were fantastic! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had great reviews and a fair rate, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific task cleaning up after it also.</p>
