<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the right length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, simply link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if essential, to place the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you may have to make a time-wasting trip to the shop.
