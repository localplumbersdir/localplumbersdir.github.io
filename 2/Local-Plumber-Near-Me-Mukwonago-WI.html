If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay might be greater.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends upon the level of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
