<p>The conventional water heater has a tank that is filled with continuously heated water. It wastes energy by holding the temperature of water that is not presently in usage.

An RP on a public or community pool should be tested upon installation and then yearly.</p>
<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are devices that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water.

When the resin beads become filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride service ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
