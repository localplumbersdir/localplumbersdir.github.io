<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements might have very tight tolerances that need to be preserved. A crucial thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is an extremely vital part of the design of each component. If the component is not repaired properly, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than direct or stable) of the element, which could trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
