Again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub.

These BFP's, if testable, are required to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>

<p>Picture living in a home with soft water-- a home where you do not have weird films on your dishes or mirrors, can lather soap quickly, and don't need to stress over scaling on the inside or outside of your devices. Sounds good, doesn't it? What if we told you that you could do all of that with a tankless, saltless water softener? Well, with NuvoH2O eco-friendly water systems for houses, you can.</p>
