<p>The on-demand gas heater can conserve as much as 35% of the energy needed for heated water if your house uses around 45 gallons of hot water each day. They can also minimize the energy required for homes with far higher requirements also. Houses that utilize over 80 gallons of hot water every day can conserve as much as 14% by switching to these smaller sized water heaters.

They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heat pump is on top of the hot water heater. Also, hybrids need approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to capture adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to discharge the condensate.</p>
