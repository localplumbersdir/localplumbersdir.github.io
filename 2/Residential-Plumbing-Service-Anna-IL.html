Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
