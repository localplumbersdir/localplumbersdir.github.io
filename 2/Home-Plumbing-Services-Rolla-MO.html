Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and reduces the basic structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Improper installation is likewise a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to identify.</p>
<p>Examine Valves and Dual Checks. There are two other kinds of backflow preventers offered that you may encounter. The very first is a check valve. The second is a dual check". It is NOT the very same thing as a Check despite the fact that it may be marketed as one! Don't get duped! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Dual Checks have losses similar to Check (5 PSI).</p>
