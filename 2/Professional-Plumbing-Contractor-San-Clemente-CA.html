<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be attached to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws initially meant for the disposer discharge elbow. If your package just consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint. The successive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can cause improper drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you might have the ability to cut off its elbow and utilize the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>

<p>First consider your alternatives if you are looking to replace an existing underground sewer pipe that has begun to leak. A complete sewer pipe replacement may not be required. Often, relining your existing pipes is a better option. If your sewer lines are underneath trees, near comprehensive landscaping, sidewalks, driveways or other semi-permanent features, overall sewer excavation can cause a good deal of collateral damage (and cost) to the surrounding area.</p>
<p>Clogged toilets are among the most typical plumbing concerns plumbers face, and for lots of people, it's an emergency when the toilet is all set to overflow.
