The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are eliminated the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>
<p>On its own, natural gas is colorless and odorless. The majority of utility companies add a sulfur substance to natural gas, which is where the rotten egg odor comes from.
