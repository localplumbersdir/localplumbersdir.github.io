<p>Fire department connections can be an issue when utilized in fighting a fire. Firefighters by and large are not interested in backflow prevention problems. They are interesting in protecting individuals's lives and to a lesser extent their home. Getting the needed volume of water on a fire is their objective and they will use water from any source offered to accomplish that goal. This can create cross-connection control problems and may as an outcome imply that the level of security on the fire security system may need to be increased to a high hazard defense level.</p>
