<p>Inspect the house's warm water heater You will be seeking to see if it is big enough to accommodate your needs (a household of 4 must have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the water heater's age. Check to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can choose the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will indicate that less water will be warmed and offered for use. Also, rust of the tank's elements can cause the tank to have a brief life. Request that a new one be set up if the water heater is old or you see obvious indications of rust.</p>
