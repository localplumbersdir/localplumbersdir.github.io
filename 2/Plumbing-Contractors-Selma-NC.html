<p>E.R. Services comprehends the importance of maintaining the integrity and performance of your kitchen. Sediment Accumulation: If you observe odd popping, banging, or clanging noises originating from your unit, this could be an indication that sediment has developed in your tank, and is causing a response with the heating element. Lacking hot water rapidly is another sign of sediment build-up, because the sediment is taking up more space in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are designed to offer decades of protection. There are lots of regional conditions that can reduce the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as extreme pressure, water temperature, turbidity or quality can all trigger the assembly to degrade in its performance. Some backflow prevention assemblies may hardly ever need repair while some are fixed regularly. The test data from the field test will identify the repair frequency.</p>
