<h3>Everything You Need To Know About A Blocked Drain in Hudson MA 01749</h3>

<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends upon the extent of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
