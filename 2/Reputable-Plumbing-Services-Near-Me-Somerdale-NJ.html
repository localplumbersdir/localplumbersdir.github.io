Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is very low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is an exceptionally pure type of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>When utilized in battling a fire, fire department connections can be a problem. Firefighters by and big are not worried about backflow prevention problems. They are concerning with safeguarding people's lives and to a lesser level their residential or commercial property. Getting the necessary volume of water on a fire is their objective and they will utilize water from any source offered to achieve that goal. This can develop cross-connection control problems and may as an outcome suggest that the level of defense on the fire protection system might need to be increased to a high risk defense level.</p>
