<h3>The Many Services Provided By Residential Plumbers Somerton AZ</h3>
<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves must prevent backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
<p>Since of the inherent design of a reduced pressure backflow assembly, fluctuating supply pressure on an extremely low circulation or static flow condition may cause problem leaking and potential fouling of the assembly. While not effective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve right away ahead of the RPZ will often hold the pressure continuous to the assembly in times of varying supply pressure.</p>
