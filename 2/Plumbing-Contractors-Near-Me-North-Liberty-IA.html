<p>Strong sewage smell in your bathroom and other areas of your house. A sewage smell emanating from your bathroom or another area of your home can be a sign of a serious problem with your plumbing. Pipes in your house may have burst or otherwise broken. If there is a consistent sewage odor in your house, it is important that you call a qualified plumber. Raw sewage is very hazardous and can position major health risks.</p>
<p>A. Typically wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

For additional information, contact the Well and Septic Division at (937) 225-4428. If owner chooses to desert the well, the well will need to be checked.
