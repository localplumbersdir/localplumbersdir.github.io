<p>Sometimes, a natural gas line may be covered if it is burst. If a contractor is working on a person's landscaping and inadvertently burst a line, this type of circumstance might take place. A house owner's policy may cover this kind of repair. In addition, if a rupture is created by an utility company, it might be covered.
