If your water softener is leaking during regrowth, you ought to wait up until after the cycle is finished and after that inspected the system for fractures or broken fittings. You must also examine to make certain your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
