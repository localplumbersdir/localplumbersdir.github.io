<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is a choice to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for numerous years, however steel eventually experiences rust and lacks the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<p>The cost to replace galvanized pipes is from $2,000 to $15,000 depending on if you use PEX, copper, or another product. Replacing galvanized pipes in older houses is essential because of the way galvanized pipes tend to degrade over the years. Galvanized pipe is made by coating steel pipe with zinc. As time moves on, the zinc wears down, exposing the steel.</p>
