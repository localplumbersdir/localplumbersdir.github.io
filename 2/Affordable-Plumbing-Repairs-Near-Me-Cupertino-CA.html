<p>E.R. Services understands the importance of keeping the stability and performance of your kitchen. Sediment Build-Up: If you discover strange popping, banging, or clanging sounds originating from your unit, this might be an indicator that sediment has actually built up in your tank, and is triggering a reaction with the heating element. Lacking hot water quickly is another indication of sediment accumulation, because the sediment is taking up more space in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>
