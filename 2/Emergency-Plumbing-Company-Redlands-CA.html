<h3>Helpful Tips For Selecting A Reputable, Budget Friendly Plumber Redlands CA</h3>
<p>These men were fantastic! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for several years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I selected this company because they had excellent evaluations and a reasonable price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
