<p>You most likely know one thing about your drains: they take water from your showers, sinks, and bath tubs to a local water treatment facility. When drains are working correctly that's actually all you need to understand about them, but when something fails, you need to have a much deeper understanding of what kinds of problems can take place in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage. That's where a professional plumber can be found in-- they have the know-how to identify a problem and the tools and understanding to fix it.</p>
<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when searching for a viable option, particularly when basic plunging does not appear to work. However, there are lots of disadvantages to utilizing these dangerous items - not least of which is that they normally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, however at the cost of presenting the danger of harm to your house and household.</p>
