<p>Your storm drains don't go directly into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is usually transported elsewhere to a neighboring treatment plant, a creek, and even the ocean in.

<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange website. When all the salt exchange websites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>There are 2 main types of backflow systems: air gap (AG) and decreased pressure valve assembly (RPZ). It's estimated that each person uses around 80-100 gallons of water a day.
