<p>If it becomes hard to turn; it's likely you've experienced an obstruction, turn the deal with counterclockwise. Reverse the auger to pull it out of the drain and clear it of debris.

<p>If you have an older house, there's a great chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing the end of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they start to wear away. This rust can result in an accumulation of lead, which can have numerous unfavorable impacts on your health. Corroded pipes also cause bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>If the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is an indicator the tank is failing and will need to be replaced. Schedule a price quote as soon as possible and guarantee absolutely nothing is near the heater that might be possibly damaged if it is in a garage and a little sluggish leak. Leaking hot water heater can burst triggering water damage and flooding of houses.</p>
