<p>A. If you have rust areas, using phosphoric acid normally will help eliminate them. If you would like to attempt the gentlest method perhaps attempt using some Coke on the rust first.  No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola contains a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke. Clean with a soft fabric and then more Coke, over and over, etc. If that does not work then use Naval Jelly which consists of a lot more phosphoric acid (make certain to read the directions and security warnings initially!).
