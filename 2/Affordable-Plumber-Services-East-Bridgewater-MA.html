<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first try using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. Much of these cleaners contain focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really harmful if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these products, please make sure to take the suitable safety measures.</p>
