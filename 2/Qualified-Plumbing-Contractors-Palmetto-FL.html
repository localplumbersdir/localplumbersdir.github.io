<h2>Tips To Hire Affordable Plumbing Contractor in Palmetto</h2>

<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were constructed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This deterioration, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
