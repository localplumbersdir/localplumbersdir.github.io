<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is really a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk scenarios is because if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.
