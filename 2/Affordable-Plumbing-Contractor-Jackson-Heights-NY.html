<p>If there's an existing disposal, utilize the handy self-service wrenchette to disengage the old unit from the bottom of the sink. It will fit in the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it free. Several homes in my neighborhood being repiped and have spoken to next-door neighbors about the problems leading up to this. If the leak isn't spotted quickly, apparently it begins with pin hole leakages in the copper piping and can cause major damage.</p>
<p>A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing fixtures unusable. Whether you have a sink that doesn't drain appropriately or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can assist. Sometimes drain repair needs can be solved fairly rapidly by a knowledgeable handyman. At other times, however, parts of a drain may need to be dismantled, taken a look at, and cleared before being changed. In some cases, a handyman may identify that a replacement part is necessary (like a tailpiece, pvc, or reducer  trap) to make sure normal operation for your drain. Call a Sears Handyman agent today to talk about repair options.</p>
