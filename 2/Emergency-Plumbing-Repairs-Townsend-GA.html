<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your home, that makes its plumbing's efficient operating a requirement more than a need. Once the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure. It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on extremely slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air should be eliminated from the plumbing system.
