<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and detailed plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire house repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 year old Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. It was a hard task because of the age of your home and place of the pipe. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>

<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a practical option, particularly when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are numerous disadvantages to using these hazardous items - not least of which is that they generally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life.
