<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged waste disposal unit is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at an affordable quantity, there should be no problem in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you need to most likely not take into the waste disposal unit though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another tip to stop clogging is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for numerous seconds after you are finished cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>

<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is essential that the repair specialist understands the correct installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
<p>When pipes are arranged into a vertical kind it is described as a hydrostatic loop. In this configuration the loop need to be greater than 33 feet to operate appropriately. When created in this manner it prevents siphoning and backflow into a water supply.
