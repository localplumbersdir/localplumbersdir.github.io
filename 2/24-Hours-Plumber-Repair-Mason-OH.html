<p>Many house owners will utilize a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to solve their clogged or filthy drain issues. These chemicals are simple to utilize and low-cost, however they harm your pipes and their impacts are only short-term.

<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
