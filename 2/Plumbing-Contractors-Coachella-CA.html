Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
