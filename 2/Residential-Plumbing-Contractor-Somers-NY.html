<p>Check Valves and Double Checks. There are two other kinds of backflow preventers available that you may run into. The very first is a check valve. The 2nd is a dual check". It is NOT the exact same thing as a Check despite the fact that it may be marketed as one! Do not get ripped off! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Double Checks have losses comparable to Check (5 PSI).</p>
