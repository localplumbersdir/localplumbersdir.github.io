<h3>Outdoor Faucet Repair in Folsom Louisiana</h2>
<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Organic debris, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, drain or cable television auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself project. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
