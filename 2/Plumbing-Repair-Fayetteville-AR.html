<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
