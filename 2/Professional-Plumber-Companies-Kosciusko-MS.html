<p>These men were fantastic! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I picked this company since they had great reviews and a reasonable cost, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic job cleaning up after it too.</p>
