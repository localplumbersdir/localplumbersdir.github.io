<h3>Trusted Home Plumbing Services Lake Villa IL</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your structure requires a backflow preventer or several devices, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in exceptionally rare cases where the building is deemed to not pose a danger to the supply of water, need to be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, along with a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
<p>To make it basic, house owners with testable backflow devices are supposed to have them evaluated by a certified tester each year. The most typical testable backflow device found at Minnesota houses is a pressure vacuum breaker, which is a device that is discovered on nearly every residential yard watering system (aka sprinkler system), revealed listed below.</p>
