<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Dudley NC</h3>
<p>Contrary to what many think, having a garbage disposal really safeguards your pipes and extends their life expectancy. Food cleaned down a drain inadvertently or on purpose without a disposal can get stuck in pipe turns, causing blockages and slowly damaging your plumbing system. Tiny food particles produced by a garbage disposal wash straight down easily.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove particles such as difficult water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>
