<p>Re-piping is a procedure of changing the water supply pipes in a home or structure. It is a total replacement of your supply plumbing system. Repiping is a process of installing a brand-new water line plumbing system. This procedure usually includes removing old readily accessible pipes and then setting up the new plumbing system.

<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
