<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, which makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a requirement more than a need. As soon as the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is essential that the plumbing system be turned on extremely gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to make sure no valves were accidentally exposed or did not close effectively when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
