<h3>Some of the Best Tips for Dealing With Drain Problems in Ventura CA 93003</h3>
<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Use a service of baking soda and vinegar regularly to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner regular monthly to keep your drains clear. We recommend natural products, such as Bio-Clean, because they work better than products consisting of harsh chemicals and won't trigger damage to your drains or components.</p>
<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a terrific person. He told me precisely what to expect (cost, time, process) up front and provided as promised. I will certainly use Clog Dawg again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These rates are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The overall you pay might be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>Usually, the cost to replace a toilet ranges between $ 122 and $228, with most homeowners spending around $ 150 to $180. This does not include the rate of the toilet, which averages $ 99 to $199, for a total toilet replacement cost of $ 221 to $427. A high-efficiency toilet with additional features can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The typical installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour. If you're changing an existing toilet, add $ 30 to $50 to eliminate your old toilet.</p>
<p>In the meantime, nevertheless, we recommend you very first try using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. Many of these cleaners include focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely hazardous if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please ensure to take the suitable safety measures if utilizing one of these items.</p>
