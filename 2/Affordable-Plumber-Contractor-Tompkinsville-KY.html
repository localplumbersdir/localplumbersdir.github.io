<h3>Necessary Plumbing Services From Plumbing Contractors Tompkinsville KY</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves ought to avoid backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand run valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
<p>Whenever the pressure on the home (downstream) side goes beyond the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. However, while DCV systems are thought about safe for many fire defense systems, they do have a defect: if both valves fail or particles in the water line prevents them from closing completely, backflow can occur.</p>
