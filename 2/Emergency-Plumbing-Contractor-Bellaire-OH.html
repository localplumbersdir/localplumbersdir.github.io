<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from the house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, rust or collapsed pipes. Property owners may have a video inspection done to find the reason for routine sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or buying an older house.</p>
