Fluctuations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt a properly functioning RPZ assembly to periodically release percentages of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a large volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be set up in areas subject to water damage. Sufficient drainage needs to also be provided.</p>
