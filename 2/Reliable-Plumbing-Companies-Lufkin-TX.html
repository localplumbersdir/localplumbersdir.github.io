<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a full repipe in specific neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>

It has two spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is actually a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
