<p>The source or location of a sewer issue identifies who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (normally 10 feet large) where main sewage systems pass through private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>Some consumers like to have softer water and choose to install a water softening system. Once again, it's individual preference and completely up to the individual consumer. Contact us right now if you see any of these signs to have a Rainaldi plumbing professional check your water lines or pipes prior to its far too late. Our check-up, integrated with a preventive maintenance schedule, will guarantee your plumbing and drainage systems are working effectively. In truth, our plumbers can even install an auto-injection system which can get rid of expensive grease-related problems that cause sluggish and stopped drains.</p>
