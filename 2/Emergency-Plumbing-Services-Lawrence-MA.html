<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Lawrence MA</h3>
<p>The most reliable way to resolve tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>There are other advantages to water softening, too. It is a well established technology that has been utilized in homes for nearly 65 years. The equipment is reliable, effective, and commonly available, offering consumers with convenient features and a selective market. The simple technology of softening makes it easy to bypass toilets and outdoor faucets. Lastly softening systems are adaptable for blending softened and unsoftened water to produce a lower hardness level.</p>
