<h3>Qualities Of Good Emergency Plumbers Summerfield NC</h3>
<p>These men were remarkable! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I chose this company since they had great reviews and a fair rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great task tidying up after it too.</p>
