<p>E.R. Services understands the value of preserving the integrity and effectiveness of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a positive charge. Salt, the mineral that water softeners use to replace hardness ions, likewise has a favorable charge, so none of these ions are attracted to each other.

When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is decreasing, the heavy salt water option is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the salt water tank lacks salt, the water going through the system will no longer be softened.</p>
