<h3>How to Ensure Drain Cleaning Services Are Performed Correctly in Bonne Terre MO 63628</h3>
<p>First consider your options if you are looking to replace an existing underground sewer pipe that has actually started to leak. A full sewer pipe replacement may not be required. Frequently, relining your existing pipes is a much better option. If your sewer lines are underneath trees, near extensive landscaping, sidewalks, driveways or other semi-permanent features, total sewer excavation can cause a lot of collateral damage (and expense) to the surrounding area.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is normally the culprit. But not always. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely. A chain with insufficient slack can cause problem too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
