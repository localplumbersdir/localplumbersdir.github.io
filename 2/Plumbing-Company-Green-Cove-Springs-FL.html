<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, corrosion or collapsed pipes.

<p>Some pipe materials are more affordable than others; some are more fragile and susceptible to splitting, displacement or other types of structural failure.

<p>Whether a water supply is identified "soft" or "tough" depends on the presence of 2 extremely soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium.
