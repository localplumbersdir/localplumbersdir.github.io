<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, carefully listen and lift the rod. You may be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A below). Flex the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make certain it's adjusted correctly (Picture 8). You do not have to clear the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
<p>When the pressure in a private water system goes beyond the pressure in the public water distribution lines that can trigger typical flow to reverse, backpressure takes place. A pump used to increase the water pressure within a structure's plumbing system to reach a greater floor may cause this. Preventive cleaning for drains need to be carried out on all drains, including toilet, floor, tub and sink drains.</p>
