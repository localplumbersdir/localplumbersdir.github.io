<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater at Odessa FL 33556</h3>
<p>Remember that repiping a house is a major plumbing repair, and you must just work with a trusted and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to make sure that the task is done right. The average cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For multiple installs, expenses vary from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Leak legs record wetness so that it doesn't get in the control system. Although small pieces of sediment might get through a drip leg.</p>
