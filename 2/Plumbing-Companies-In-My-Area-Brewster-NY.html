<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk situations is because if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.
