<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the degree of the rot.

Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
