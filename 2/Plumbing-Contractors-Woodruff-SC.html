Sediment Accumulation: If you notice weird popping, banging, or clanging sounds originating from your unit, this might be a sign that sediment has developed in your tank, and is triggering a reaction with the heating element. Running out of hot water rapidly is another sign of sediment build-up, since the sediment is taking up more space in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat. To fix this issue, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
