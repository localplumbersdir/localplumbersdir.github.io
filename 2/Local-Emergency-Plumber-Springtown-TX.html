<p>Aside from these 2 crucial components, there are a myriad of small, possibly less vital things that can deteriorate or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more quickly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled.

We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>
