<p>Replacing your sink is a step-by-step procedure. Procedure, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to attaching any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings before connecting the system to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it may require additional adapters, flexible tubing is far simpler to deal with and can make use of push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
