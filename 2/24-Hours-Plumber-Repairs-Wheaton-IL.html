<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on.
