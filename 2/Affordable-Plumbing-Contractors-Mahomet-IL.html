If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom.
