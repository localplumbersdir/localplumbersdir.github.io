<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine showed effective, Sam Blanc developed and built a smaller design that ran on the exact same concept but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains in addition to laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also constructed a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be hauled by a truck and featured a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning big commercial and community sewer pipes. An enhanced version called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable television. It was discontinued in 1973.</p>
<p>Roto-Rooter was included in the SyFy television show Ghost Hunters (2004-2016) as the 2 founders of TAPS work for Roto-Rooter as plumbers in the company's Providence, Rhode Island branch.
