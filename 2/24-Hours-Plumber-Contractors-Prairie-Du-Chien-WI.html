<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for setting up backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Standard for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Security Systems for performing yearly forward circulation tests are often perceived as a mandate to have them. However the intent of the code is to only connect installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers exist.</p>
<p>One common method for a home's water supply to be infected is if the watering water lines, which could become tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that infected water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply, the problem could spread exponentially. A backflow preventer not only safeguards drinking water in private homes, it likewise avoids wastewater in personal homes from flowing back out and contaminating the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>Do not utilize ground joint unions except directly at the meter or after the shutoff valve at the home appliance. Each place where you will have a gas device need to have a gas shutoff valve. Within the City of Seattle only, anybody who sets up gas piping on residential or commercial property not under their ownership need to possess a Seattle Gas Piping Mechanic License. All gas piping installations need a license and inspection.</p>
