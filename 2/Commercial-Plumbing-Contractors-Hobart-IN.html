<p>Carefully listen and lift the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. If the water shuts off, you might have the ability to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no modification screw, bend the float arm.
