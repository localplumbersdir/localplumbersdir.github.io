<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a terrific person. He informed me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) in advance and provided as promised. I will absolutely use Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay might be greater.</p>
<p>A waste disposal unit lasts approximately 10 to 12 years. This typical lifespan estimation presumes typical wear and tear of the unit. The lifespan of a waste disposal unit might be lower in the case of disregard, overuse, and abuse of the disposal unit. Time for a brand-new bathroom or kitchen sink installation? Have a drain connection or other problem that requires a kitchen or bathroom sink repair? Our plumbing services are ready for both residential and commercial needs-- laundry rooms, cooking areas, and restrooms along with a public lavatory, wash, janitorial, and prep sinks.</p>
<p>There are health and wellness dangers one should avoid while dealing with a sewer line project.

If your Do It Yourself dig strikes a natural gas line, breathing the gas can damage your body, and there is a risk of fire or surge damage to your residential or commercial property or your neighbor's. Another risk in sewer repair projects is the collapse of earth from the walls around the dig site. Your security and health are too important to run the risk of in a Do It Yourself sewer project! Prevent these security threats by hiring a professional plumber.</p>
