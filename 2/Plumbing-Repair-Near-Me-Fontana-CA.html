<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as difficult water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>
