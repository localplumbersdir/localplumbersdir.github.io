<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
