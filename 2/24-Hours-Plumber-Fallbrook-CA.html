<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer system calculates the amount of water that streams through the softener. Regeneration automatically starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and family of 4, regeneration generally occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above techniques do not work, the next step would be to eliminate the P-trap under the sink. Place a container beneath the area to catch water then loosen the 2 threaded caps that hold the curved section of the pipe in location.
